Usage
-----

In order to use the git.php file, you must create a file called 
remote-update-token.txt and place a value in there. You must then call
the git.php file with a URL parameter named 'token' set to the value in
the file. For example:

http://json-ld.org/utils/git.php?token=7384724849

While this is not a fool-proof security solution, it'll be good enough
for now. Updates are throttled, even in the event of a DDoS, the update
rate is once every 5 seconds.
