<p>
JSON [[!RFC4627]] has proven to be a highly useful object serialization and
messaging format. JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] harmonizes the representation of
Linked Data in JSON by outlining a common JSON representation format for
expressing directed graphs; mixing both Linked Data and non-Linked Data in
a single document. This document outlines an Application Programming
Interface and a set of algorithms for programmatically transforming
JSON-LD documents in order to make them easier to work with in programming
environments like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
</p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
<p>This document has been under development for over 18 months in the
JSON for Linking Data Community Group. The document has recently been
transferred to the RDF Working Group for review, improvement, and publication
along the Recommendation track. The specification has undergone significant
development, review, and changes during the course of the last 18 months.
</p>
<p>There are several independent
<a href="http://json-ld.org/#impl">interoperable implementations</a> of
this specification. There is
a <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/tree/master/test-suite">fairly complete test suite</a>
and a <a href="http://json-ld.org/playground/">live JSON-LD editor</a>
that is capable of demonstrating the features described in
this document. While development on implementations, the test suite
and the live editor will continue, they are believed to be mature enough
to be integrated into a non-production system at this point in time with
the expectation that they could be used in a production system within the
next year.
</p>
<p class="issue">
It is important for readers to understand that the scope of this document is
currently under debate and new features may be added to the specification.
Existing features may be modified heavily or removed entirely from the
specification upon further review and feedback from the broader community.
This is a work in progress and publication as a Working Draft
does not require that all Working Group members agree on the content of the
document.
</p>

<p>There are a number of ways that one may participate in the development of
  this specification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to make sure that your feedback is formally addressed by
    the RDF Working Group, you should send it to public-rdf-comments:

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document is a detailed specification for an Application Programming
Interface for the JSON-LD Syntax. The document is primarily intended for
the following audiences:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web authors and developers that want a very detailed view of how
  a JSON-LD processor and the API operates.</li>
  <li>Software developers that want to implement processors and APIs for
  JSON-LD.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
JSON, which is detailed in [[!RFC4627]]. You must also understand the
JSON-LD Syntax [[!JSON-LD]], which is the base syntax used by all of the
algorithms in this document. To understand the API and how it is
intended to operate in a programming environment, it is useful to have working
knowledge of the JavaScript programming language [[ECMA-262]] and
WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]]. To understand how JSON-LD maps to RDF, it is helpful to be
familiar with the basic RDF concepts [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]].</p>

</section>

<section class="informative">
<h1>Features</h1>

<p>The JSON-LD Syntax specification [[!JSON-LD]] outlines a language that may be
  used to express Linked Data in JSON. Often, it is useful to be able to transform
  JSON-LD documents so that they may be easily processed in various programming
  environments.</p>

<p>There are four major types of transformation that are discussed in this document:
  expansion, compaction, flattening, and RDF conversion.</p>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Expansion</h2>
  <p>Software algorithms are easiest to write when the data that they are processing
    have a regular form. Since information can be represented by JSON-LD in a
    variety of different ways, transforming all of these methods into a uniform
    structure allows the developer to simplify their processing code. For example,
    note that the following input uses only <tref>term</tref>s and is fairly
    compact:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    },
    "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
    "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
    "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The next input example uses one <tref>IRI</tref> to express a property, but leaves
    the rest of the information untouched.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    },
    "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name****": "Markus Lanthaler",
    "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>While both inputs are valid JSON-LD, writing a program to handle every
    permutation of possible inputs can be difficult, especially when the incoming
    context could change as well. To ensure that the data can be given a more
    uniform structure, JSON-LD introduces the notion of expansion. <tdef>Expansion</tdef>
    performs two important operations. The first is to expand all values that represent
    <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> to <tref title="absolute IRI">absolute IRIs</tref>.
    The second is to express all values in <tref>expanded form</tref>. Running the
    <a href="#expansion-algorithm">Expansion algorithm</a> against the examples provided
    above results in the following output:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  [
    {
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
        { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
      ],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
        { "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/" }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Note that in the output above all <tref>context</tref> definitions have
    been removed, all <tref title="term">terms</tref> and <tref title="prefix">prefixes</tref>
    have been expanded to absolute <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>, and all
    <tref title="JSON-LD value">JSON-LD values</tref> are expressed in <tref>expanded form</tref>.
    While the output is more difficult for a human to read, it is easier for a
    software program to process because of its very regular structure.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Compaction</h2>
  <p>While expansion expands a given input as much as possible, compaction performs
    the opposite operation: it expresses a given input as succinctly as possible. In contrast
    to expansion which is meant to produce something that is easy to process by software
    programs, compaction is meant to produce something that is easy to read by software
    developers. Compaction uses a developer-supplied <tref>context</tref> to compress
    <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> to <tref title="term">terms</tref> or
    <tref title="compact IRI">compact IRIs</tref> and <tref title="JSON-LD value">JSON-LD values</tref>
    expressed in <tref>expanded form</tref> to simple values such as
    <tref title="string">strings</tref> and <tref title="number">numbers</tref>.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following expanded JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  [
    {
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
        { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
      ],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
        { "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/" }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD <tref>context</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Running the <a href="#compaction-algorithm">Compaction Algorithm</a> given the context
    supplied above against the JSON-LD input document provided above would result in the
    following output:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    },
    "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
    "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
    "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Note that all <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> have been compacted to
    <tref title="term">terms</tref> as specified in the <tref>context</tref>
    which consequently has been injected into the output. While compacted
    output is most useful to humans, it can often also be used to generate
    structures that are easy to program against. Compaction enables developers
    to map any expanded document into an application-specific compacted document.
    While the context provided above mapped <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>
    to <code>name</code>, it could have also have been mapped to any other term
    provided by the developer.</p>

</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Flattening</h2>
  <p>While expansion ensures that a document is in a uniform structure, flattening
    goes a step further and ensures that also the shape of the data is deterministic.
    In expanded documents properties of a single <tref>node</tref> may still be
    spread across a number of different <tref title="JSON object">JSON objects</tref>.
    By flattening a document, all properties of a <tref>node</tref> are collected in a
    single <tref>JSON object</tref> and all <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
    are labeled with a <tref>blank node identifier</tref>. Often this drastically
    simplifies the code to process JSON-LD data.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
    },
    "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
    "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
    "knows": [
      {
        "name": "Manu Sporny",
        "knows": {
          "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"
        }
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
        "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
      }
    ]
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Running the <a href="#flattening-algorithm">Flattening Algorithm</a>
    with a context set to <tref>null</tref> to prevent compaction returns
    the following document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  [
    {
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
        { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
      ],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
        { "@id": "_:t0" },
        { "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "@id": "_:t0",
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
        { "@value": "Manu Sporny" }
      ],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
        { "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
        { "@value": "Gregg Kellogg" }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Note how in the output above all properties of a <tref>node</tref> are collected in a
    single <tref>JSON object</tref> and how the <tref>blank node</tref> representing
    &quot;Manu Sporny&quot; has been assigned the <tref>blank node identifier</tref>
    <code>_:t0</code>.</p>

  <p>To make it easier for humans to read such a flattened document can be compacted by
    passing a context. Using the same context as the input document, the flattened
    and compacted document looks as follows:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
    },
    "@graph": [
      {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
        "knows": [
          { "@id": "_:t0" },
          { "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "@id": "_:t0",
        "name": "Manu Sporny",
        "knows": {
          "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"
        }
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me",
        "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
      }
    ]
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Please note that the flattened and compacted result will always explicitly
    designate the default by the <code>@graph</code> member in the top-level
    <tref>JSON object</tref>. <a href="#compaction">Compaction</a> optimizes that
    member away if its value contains just one item.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>RDF Conversion</h2>
  <p>JSON-LD can be used to serialize data expressed in RDF as described in
    [[RDF-CONCEPTS]]. This ensures that data can be round-tripped from and to
    any RDF syntax without any loss in the fidelity of the data.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following RDF input serialized in Turtle [[TURTLE-TR]]:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Markus Lanthaler" .
  <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage> <http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/> .
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Using the <a href="#convert-from-rdf-algorithm">Convert from RDF Algorithm</a> a
    developer could transform this document into expanded JSON-LD:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
  <!--
  [
    {
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
        {
          "@value": "Markus Lanthaler"
        }
      ],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
        {
          "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Note that the output above could easily be compacted using the technique outlined
    in the previous section. It is also possible to transform the JSON-LD document back
    to RDF using the <a href="#convert-to-rdf-algorithm">Convert to RDF Algorithm</a>.</p>

  <p>A conforming <tdef>JSON-LD Processor</tdef> is a conforming <tref>JSON-LD Implementation</tref>
    that exposes the application programming interface (API) defined in this specification.</p>

  <p>The algorithms in this specification are generally written with more concern for clarity than
    over efficiency. Thus, JSON-LD Implementations and Processors may implement the algorithms
    given in this specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is indistinguishable
    from the result that would be obtained by the specification's algorithms.</p>

  <p>This specification does not define how JSON-LD Implementations or Processors handle
    non-conforming input documents. This implies that JSON-LD Implementations or Processors
    MUST NOT attempt to correct malformed IRIs or language tags; however, they MAY issue
    validation warnings.</p>

  <p class="note">Implementers can partially check their level of conformance to
    this specification by successfully passing the test cases of the JSON-LD test
    suite [[JSON-LD-TESTS]]. Note, however, that passing all the tests in the test
    suite does not imply complete conformance to this specification. It only implies
    that the implementation conforms to aspects tested by the test suite.</p>

  <h3>General Terminology</h3>

  <p>This document uses the following terms as defined in JSON [[!RFC4627]]. Refer
    to the <em>JSON Grammar</em> section in [[!RFC4627]] for formal definitions.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><tdef>JSON object</tdef></dt>
    <dd>An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets
      surrounding zero or more key-value pairs. A key is a
      <tref>string</tref>. A single colon comes after each key, separating the
      key from the value. A single comma separates a value from a following
      key.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>array</tdef></dt>
    <dd>An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero
      or more values (or elements). Elements are separated by commas.
      In JSON, an array is an <em>ordered</em> sequence of zero or more values.
      While JSON-LD uses the same array representation as JSON,
      the collection is <em>unordered</em> by default. While order is
      preserved in regular JSON arrays, it is not in regular JSON-LD arrays
      unless specific markup is provided (see <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>).</dd>
    <dt><tdef>string</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters,
      wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes (if necessary). A
      character is represented as a single character string.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>number</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A number is similar to that used in most programming languages, except
      that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used and that leading
      zeros are not allowed.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>true</tdef> and <tdef>false</tdef></dt>
    <dd>Values that are used to express one of two possible boolean states.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>null</tdef></dt>
    <dd>The <tref>null</tref> value. A key-value pair in the
      <code>@context</code> where the value, or the <code>@id</code> of the
      value, is <tref>null</tref> explicitly decouples a term's association
      with an IRI. A key-value pair in the body of a JSON-LD document whose
      value is <tref>null</tref> has the same meaning as if the key-value pair
      was not defined. If <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>, or
      <code>@set</code> is set to <tref>null</tref> in expanded form, then
      the entire <tref>JSON object</tref> is ignored.</dd>

  <h2>Expansion Algorithm</h2>

  <p>The algorithm takes three input variables: an <tref>active context</tref>,
    an <tref>active property</tref>, and an <em>element</em> to be expanded. To
    begin, the <tref>active context</tref> is set to the result of performing, <a

    is <tref>null</tref>, <tref>active property</tref> is set to <tref>null</tref>, and
    <em>element</em> is set to the <tref>JSON-LD input</tref>. This algorithm expects the

  <h2 id="context">Context Processing</h2>

  <p>Processing of JSON-LD data structure is managed recursively. During processing, each
    rule is applied using information provided by the <tref>active context</tref>.</p>

  <p>The <tref>active context</tref> contains the active <tdef title="term definition">term definitions</tdef>
    which specify how properties and values have to be interpreted as well as the current
    <tdef>vocabulary mapping</tdef> and the <tdef>default language</tdef>. Each <tref>term definition</tref> consists
    of an <tdef>IRI mapping</tdef> and optionally a <tdef>type mapping</tdef> from terms to datatypes or
    <tdef>language mapping</tdef> from terms to language codes, and a <tdef>container mapping</tdef>. If an
    <tref>IRI mapping</tref> maps a term to multiple <tref="IRI">IRIs</tref> it is said to be a
    <tdef>property generator</tdef>.</p>

  <p>If a <tref>local context</tref> is encountered, information from the <tref>local context</tref>
    is merged into the <tref>active context</tref>. A <tref>local context</tref> is identified within

    a <tref>local context</tref>, and an array of already included remote contexts <em>remoteContexts</em>. To
    begin, <em>remoteContexts</em> is initialized to an empty array.</p>

  <h2>IRI Expansion</h2>

  <p>In JSON-LD documents keys and some values are evaluated to produce an <tref>IRI</tref>.
    This section defines an algorithm for transforming strings representing an IRI into an
    <tref>absolute IRI</tref>. If IRI expansion occurs during context processing, the
    <tref>local context</tref> that is being processed is passed to this algorithm.
    After application of this algorithm, values processed by this algorithm are said to be
    in <tdef>expanded IRI form</tdef>, although this may also include
    <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref> and
    JSON-LD <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>.</p>

  <p>The algorithm takes two mandatory and four optional input variables: a <em>value</em>
    to be expanded, an <tref>active context</tref>, two flags <em>documentRelative</em> and
    <em>vocabRelative</em> specifying whether <em>value</em> should be interpreted as
    <tref>relative IRI</tref> against the document's base IRI or the
    <tref title="active context">active context's</tref> <tref>vocabulary mapping</tref>,
    along with an <tref>local context</tref> passed when this algorithm is used in
    <a href="#context-processing">Context Processing</a>, and finally an array
    <em>path</em> which is used to detect cyclic <tref title="IRI mapping">IRI mappings</tref>.
    If not passed, the two flags are set to <code>false</code> and <em>path</em> is
    initialized to an empty <tref>array</tref> by default.</p>

  <p>The algorithm for generating an IRI is:</p>

  <ol class="algorithm">
    <li>If <em>value</em> is <tref>null</tref> or a JSON-LD <tref>keyword</tref>, return
      <em>value</em> as is.</li>
    <li>If a <tref>local context</tref> has been passed
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>and <em>value</em> is in the <em>path</em> array, raise a
          <code class="error">CYCLIC_IRI_MAPPING</code> error. Otherwise append <em>value</em>
          to <em>path</em>.</li>
        <li>If <tref>local context</tref> contains an <tref>IRI mapping</tref> for <em>value</em>
          that is not a <tref>property generator</tref> return the result of recursively calling
          this algorithm passing the <tref>IRI</tref> of the <tref>IRI mapping</tref> as new
          <em>value</em>, the <tref>active context</tref> and <tref>local context</tref>,
          <em>path</em>, and <code>true</code> for the <em>vocabRelative</em> flag. If the result
          is a <tref>property generator</tref>, raise an
          <code class="error">PROPERTY_GENERATOR_IN_TERM_DEFINITION</code> error.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If an <tref>IRI mapping</tref> exists for <em>value</em> in the <tref>active context</tref>
      that is not a <tref>property generator</tref> return the value of the
      <tref>IRI mapping</tref>.</li>
    <li>If <em>value</em> contains a colon (<code>:</code>), perform the following steps:
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>Split <em>value</em> into a <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> at the first occurrence of
          a colon (<code>:</code>).</li>
        <li>If <em>suffix</em> begins with <code>//</code> or <em>prefix</em> equals <code>_</code>,
          return <em>value</em> as is.</li>
        <li>If a <tref>local context</tref> has been passed, expand <em>prefix</em> by recursively
          invoking this algorithm passing <em>prefix</em> as <em>value</em>, the <tref>active context</tref>
          and <tref>local context</tref>, <em>path</em>, and <code>true</code> for the
          <em>vocabRelative</em> flag. If the expanded <em>prefix</em> contains a colon (<code>:</code>)
          generate and return an <tref>IRI</tref> by prepending the expanded <em>prefix</em> to the
          (possibly empty) <em>suffix</em> using textual concatenation.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the <tref>active context</tref> contains an <tref>IRI mapping</tref> for
          <em>prefix</em> that is not a <tref>property generator</tref>, generate and return an
          <tref>IRI</tref> by prepending the <tref>IRI</tref> mapped to <em>prefix</em> to the
          (possibly empty) <em>suffix</em> using textual concatenation.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Otherwise, if the <em>vocabRelative</em> flag is set to <code>true</code> and the
      <tref>active context</tref> contains a <tref>vocabulary mapping</tref>, generate and return an
      <tref>IRI</tref> by prepending the <tref>IRI</tref> of the <tref>vocabulary mapping</tref>
      to the <em>value</em> using textual concatenation.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, if the <em>documentRelative</em> flag is set to <code>true</code>, resolve <em>value</em>

  <h2>Value Expansion</h2>

  <p>Some values in JSON-LD can be expressed in a <tref>compacted form</tref>. These values
    are required to be expanded at times when processing JSON-LD documents.
    A value is said to be in <tdef>expanded form</tdef> after
    the application of this algorithm.</p>

  <p>The algorithm for expanding a <em>value</em> takes an <tref>active property</tref>
    and <tref>active context</tref>. It is implemented as follows:</p>

  <ol class="algorithm">
    <li>If <em>value</em> is <tref>null</tref>, return <tref>null</tref>.</li>
    <li>Initialize an empty object <em>result</em>.</li>

      <tref title="active property">active property's</tref> <tref>type mapping</tref> is set to
      <code>@id</code>, add a key-value pair to <em>result</em> where the key is <code>@id</code>
      and the value is the result of expanding <em>value</em> according to the
      <a href="#iri-expansion">IRI Expansion algorithm</a> passing <code>true</code> for the
      <em>documentRelative</em> flag. Then return <em>result</em>.</li>
    <li>Add a key-value pair to <em>result</em> where the key is <code>@value</code>
      and the value is <em>value</em>.</li>
    <li>If the <tref>active property</tref> has a <tref>type mapping</tref>, add a key-value
      pair to <em>result</em> where the key is <code>@type</code> and the value is the
      <tref>IRI</tref> associated with the <tref>type mapping</tref> or a newly
      <a href="#generate-blank-node-identifier">generated blank node identifier</a> if the
      <tref>type mapping</tref> is set to a <tref>blank node identifier</tref>.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, if <em>value</em> is a <tref>string</tref> and the <tref>active property</tref> has a
      <tref>language mapping</tref> or an <tref>default language</tref> is set in the <tref>active context</tref>,
      add a key-value pair to <em>result</em> where the key is <code>@language</code> and the value is the
      language tag associated with the <tref>language mapping</tref> or the <tref>active property</tref> or the

  <h2>IRI Compaction Algorithm</h2>

  <p>This algorithm takes three mandatory and two optional parameters. The mandatory

    and a <em>vocabRelative</em> flag which specifies whether the passed <em>iri</em>
    should be compacted using the <tref title="active context">active context's</tref>

    <h2>RDF Conversion Algorithms</h2>

    <p>This specification describes algorithms to transform JSON-LD documents to an array of
      RDF <tref title="quad">quads</tref> and vice-versa. Note that many uses of JSON-LD
      may not require generation of RDF.</p>

    <p>The processing algorithms described in this section are provided in order to demonstrate
      how one might implement a JSON-LD to RDF processor. Conformant implementations are only
      required to produce the same type and number of <tref title="quad">quads</tref> but are
      not required to implement the algorithm exactly as described.</p>

      <h3>Convert to RDF Algorithm</h3>
      <p>
        The algorithm below is designed for in-memory implementations with random access to <tref>JSON object</tref> elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A conforming JSON-LD processor implementing RDF conversion MUST implement a
        processing algorithm that results in the same set of RDF <tref title="quad">quads</tref> that the following
        algorithm generates:
      </p>

      <p>The algorithm takes four input variables: a <em>element</em> to be converted, an
        <tref>active subject</tref>, <tref>active property</tref> and <tref>graph name</tref>.
        To begin, the <tref>active subject</tref>, <tref>active property</tref> and <tref>graph name</tref>
        are set to <tref>null</tref>, and <em>element</em> is
        set to the result of performing the <a href="#expansion-algorithm">Expansion Algorithm</a> on
        the <tref>JSON-LD input</tref> which is expected to be a a well-formed JSON-LD document as defined in [[!JSON-LD]].

      <h3>Data Round Tripping</h3>

      <p>When <a href="#rdf-conversion">converting JSON-LD to RDF</a> JSON-native types such as
        <em>numbers</em> and <em>booleans</em> are automatically coerced to <strong>xsd:integer</strong>,
        <strong>xsd:double</strong>, or <strong>xsd:boolean</strong>. Implementers MUST ensure that the
        result is in <tref>canonical lexical form</tref>. A
        <tdef>canonical lexical form</tdef> is a set of literals from among the valid set of literals for
        a datatype such that there is a one-to-one mapping between the <tref>canonical lexical form</tref> and a value
        in the value space as defined in [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. In other words, every value MUST be converted
        to a deterministic <tref>string</tref> representation.</p>

      <p>The canonical lexical form of an <em>integer</em>, i.e., a number without fractions
        or a number coerced to <strong>xsd:integer</strong>, is a finite-length sequence of decimal
        digits (<code>0-9</code>) with an optional leading minus sign; leading zeroes are prohibited.
        To convert the number in JavaScript, implementers can use the following snippet of code:</p>

      <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
      <!--
      (value).toFixed(0).toString()
      -->
      </pre>

      <p>The canonical lexical form of a <em>double</em>, i.e., a number with fractions
        or a number coerced to <strong>xsd:double</strong>, consists of a mantissa followed by the
        character "E", followed by an exponent. The mantissa MUST be a decimal number. The exponent
        MUST be an integer. Leading zeroes and a preceding plus sign (<code>+</code>) are prohibited
        in the exponent. If the exponent is zero, it must be indicated by <code>E0</code>.
        For the mantissa, the preceding optional plus sign is prohibited and the decimal point is
        required. Leading and trailing zeroes are prohibited subject to the following: number
        representations must be normalized such that there is a single digit which is non-zero to the
        left of the decimal point and at least a single digit to the right of the decimal point unless
        the value being represented is zero. The canonical representation for zero is <code>0.0E0</code>.
        <strong>xsd:double</strong>'s value space is defined by the IEEE double-precision 64-bit
        floating point type [[!IEEE-754-1985]]; in JSON-LD the mantissa is rounded to 15 digits after the
        decimal point.</p>

      <p>To convert the number in JavaScript, implementers can use the following snippet of code:</p>

      <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample">
      <!--
      (value).toExponential(15).replace(/(\d)0*e\+?/,'$1E')
      -->
      </pre>

      <p class="note">When data such as decimals need to be normalized, JSON-LD authors should
        not use values that are going to undergo automatic conversion. This is due to the lossy nature
        of <strong>xsd:double</strong> values. Authors should instead use the expanded object form to
        set the canonical lexical form directly.</p>

      <p>The canonical lexical form of the <em>boolean</em> values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
        are the strings <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>.</p>

      <p>When JSON-native <tref>number</tref>s, are type coerced, lossless data round-tripping can not
        be guaranted as rounding errors might occur. Additionally, only literals typed as
        <strong>xsd:integer</strong>, <strong>xsd:double</strong>, and  <strong>xsd:boolean</strong> are
        automatically converted back to their JSON-native counterparts in when
        <a href="#rdf-conversion">converting from RDF</a>.</p>

      <p>Some JSON serializers, such as PHP's native implementation in some versions,
        backslash-escape the forward slash character. For example, the value
        <code>http://example.com/</code> would be serialized as <code>http:\/\/example.com\/</code>.
        This is problematic as other JSON parsers might not understand those escaping characters.
        There is no need to backslash-escape forward slashes in JSON-LD. To aid interoperability
        between JSON-LD processors, a JSON-LD serializer MUST NOT backslash-escape forward slashes.</p>

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to convert
  JSON-LD data into a a variety of output formats that are easier to work
  with in various programming languages. If a JSON-LD API is provided in
  a programming environment, the entirety of the following API MUST be

      use to access the JSON-LD transformation methods.</p>

    <p>The JSON-LD API signatures are the same across all programming languages. Due
      to the fact that asynchronous programming is uncommon in certain languages, developers MAY
      implement a processor with a synchronous interface instead. In that case, the <code>callback</code>
      parameter MUST NOT be included and the result MUST be returned as a return value instead.</p>

    <p>It is important to highlight that conformant <tref title="JSON-LD Processor">JSON-LD processors</tref>
