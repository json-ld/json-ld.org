  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This document is a detailed specification of the JSON-LD processing algorithms.
    The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Software developers who want to implement the algorithms to transform
      JSON-LD documents.</li>
    <li>Web authors and developers who want a very detailed view of how
      a <a>JSON-LD Processor</a> operates.</li>
    <li>Developers who want an overview of the proposed JSON-LD API.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
    JSON, which is detailed in [[!RFC7159]]. You must also understand the
    JSON-LD syntax defined in [[!JSON-LD]], which is the base syntax used by all
    of the algorithms in this document. To understand the API and how it is
    intended to operate in a programming environment, it is useful to have working
    knowledge of the JavaScript programming language [[ECMA-262]] and
    WebIDL [[WebIDL-2]]. To understand how JSON-LD maps to RDF, it is helpful to be
    familiar with the basic RDF concepts [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Contributing</h2>

    <p>There are a number of ways that one may participate in the development of

  <h1>Features</h1>

  <p>The JSON-LD Syntax specification [[!JSON-LD]] defines a syntax to
    express Linked Data in JSON. Because there is more than one way to
    express Linked Data using this syntax, it is often useful to be able to
    transform JSON-LD documents so that they may be more easily consumed by
    specific applications.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD uses <a>contexts</a> to allow Linked Data
    to be expressed in a way that is specifically tailored to a particular
    person or application. By providing a <a>context</a>,
    JSON data can be expressed in a way that is a natural fit for a particular
    person or application whilst also indicating how the data should be
    understood at a global scale. In order for people or applications to
    share data that was created using a <a>context</a> that is different
    from their own, a JSON-LD processor must be able to transform a document
    from one <a>context</a> to another. Instead of requiring JSON-LD
    processors to write specific code for every imaginable
    <a>context</a> switching scenario, it is much easier to specify a
    single algorithm that can remove any <a>context</a>. Similarly,
    another algorithm can be specified to subsequently apply any
    <a>context</a>. These two algorithms represent the most basic
    transformations of JSON-LD documents. They are referred to as
    <a>expansion</a> and <a>compaction</a>, respectively.</p>

  <p>There are four major types of transformation that are discussed in this
    document: expansion, compaction, flattening, and RDF serialization/deserialization.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Expansion</h2>

    <p>The algorithm that removes <a>context</a> is
      called <dfn data-lt="expanded|expanding">expansion</dfn>. Before performing any other
      transformations on a JSON-LD document, it is easiest to
      remove any <a>context</a> from it and to make data structures
      more regular.</p>

    <p>To get an idea of how context and data structuring affects the same data,
      here is an example of JSON-LD that uses only <a>terms</a>
      and is fairly compact:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
          "@type": "@id"
        }
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
      "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The next input example uses one <a>IRI</a> to express a property
    and an <a>array</a> to encapsulate another, but
    leaves the rest of the information untouched.</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document using an IRI instead of a term to express a property">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        ****"website": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage"****
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name****": "Markus Lanthaler",
      ****"website"****: ****{ "@id":**** "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/" ****}****
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Note that both inputs are valid JSON-LD and both represent the same
      information. The difference is in their <a>context</a> information
      and in the data structures used. A JSON-LD processor can remove
      <a>context</a> and ensure that the data is more regular by employing
      <a>expansion</a>.</p>

    <p><a>Expansion</a> has two important goals: removing any contextual
      information from the document, and ensuring all values are represented
      in a regular form. These goals are accomplished by expanding all properties
      to <a>absolute IRIs</a> and by expressing all
      values in <a>arrays</a> in
      <a>expanded form</a>. <a>Expanded form</a> is the most verbose
      and regular way of expressing of values in JSON-LD; all contextual
      information from the document is instead stored locally with each value.
      Running the <a href="#expansion-algorithm">Expansion algorithm</a>
      (<a data-link-for="JsonLdProcessor">expand</a>)
      operation) against the above examples results in the following output:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Expanded sample document">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
          { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
        ],
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
          { "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Note that in the output above all <a>context</a> definitions have
      been removed, all <a>terms</a> and
      <a>compact IRIs</a> have been expanded to absolute
      <a>IRIs</a>, and all
      <a>JSON-LD values</a> are expressed in
      <a>arrays</a> in <a>expanded form</a>. While the
      output is more verbose and difficult for a human to read, it establishes a
      baseline that makes JSON-LD processing easier because of its very regular
      structure.</p>
  </section> <!-- end of Expansion -->

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Compaction</h2>

    <p>While <a>expansion</a> removes <a>context</a> from a given
      input, <dfn data-lt="compact|compacting|compacted|compacts">compaction</dfn>'s primary function is to
      perform the opposite operation: to express a given input according to
      a particular <a>context</a>. <a>Compaction</a> applies a
      <a>context</a> that specifically tailors the way information is
      expressed for a particular person or application. This simplifies applications
      that consume JSON or JSON-LD by expressing the data in application-specific
      terms, and it makes the data easier to read by humans.</p>

    <p><a>Compaction</a> uses a developer-supplied <a>context</a> to
      shorten <a>IRIs</a> to <a>terms</a> or
      <a>compact IRIs</a> and
      <a>JSON-LD values</a> expressed in
      <a>expanded form</a> to simple values such as <a>strings</a>
      or <a>numbers</a>.</p>

    <p>For example, assume the following expanded JSON-LD input document:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Expanded sample document">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
          { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
        ],
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
          { "@id": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD
      <a>context</a>:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="JSON-LD context">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
          "@type": "@id"
        }
      }
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Running the <a href="#compaction-algorithm">Compaction Algorithm</a>
      (<a data-link-for="JsonLdProcessor">compact</a>)
      operation) given the context supplied above against the JSON-LD input
      document provided above would result in the following output:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Compacted sample document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
          "@type": "@id"
        }
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
      "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/"
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Note that all <a>IRIs</a> have been compacted to
      <a>terms</a> as specified in the <a>context</a>,
      which has been injected into the output. While compacted output is
      useful to humans, it is also used to generate structures that are easy to
      program against. Compaction enables developers to map any expanded document
      into an application-specific compacted document. While the context provided
      above mapped <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code> to <code>name</code>, it
      could also have been mapped to any other term provided by the developer.</p>
  </section> <!-- end of Compaction -->

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Flattening</h2>

    <p>While expansion ensures that a document is in a uniform structure,
      flattening goes a step further to ensure that the shape of the data
      is deterministic. In expanded documents, the properties of a single
      <a>node</a> may be spread across a number of different
      <a>JSON objects</a>. By flattening a
      document, all properties of a <a>node</a> are collected in a single
      <a>JSON object</a> and all <a>blank nodes</a>
      are labeled with a <a>blank node identifier</a>. This may drastically
      simplify the code required to process JSON-LD data in certain applications.</p>

    <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
      "knows": [
        {
          "name": "Dave Longley"
        }
      ]
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Running the <a href="#flattening-algorithm">Flattening Algorithm</a>
      (<a data-link-for="JsonLdProcessor">flatten</a>)
      operation) with a context set to <a>null</a> to prevent compaction
      returns the following document:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Flattened sample document in expanded form">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "_:t0",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
          { "@value": "Dave Longley" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
          { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
        ],
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
          { "@id": "_:t0" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Note how in the output above all properties of a <a>node</a> are collected in a
      single <a>JSON object</a> and how the <a>blank node</a> representing
      &quot;Dave Longley&quot; has been assigned the <a>blank node identifier</a>
      <code>_:t0</code>.</p>

    <p>To make it easier for humans to read or for certain applications to
      process it, a flattened document can be compacted by passing a context. Using
      the same context as the input document, the flattened and compacted document
      looks as follows:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Flattened and compacted sample document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
      },
      "@graph": [
        {
          "@id": "_:t0",
          "name": "Dave Longley"
        },
        {
          "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
          "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
          "knows": { "@id": "_:t0" }
        }
      ]
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Please note that the result of flattening and <a>compacting</a> a document
      is always a <a>JSON object</a> which contains an <code>@graph</code>
      member that represents the <a>default graph</a>.</p>
  </section> <!-- end of Flattening -->

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>RDF Serialization/Deserialization</h2>

    <p>JSON-LD can be used to serialize RDF data as described in
      [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. This ensures that data can be round-tripped to and from
      any RDF syntax without any loss in fidelity.</p>

    <p>For example, assume the following RDF input serialized in Turtle [[TURTLE]]:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample Turtle document">
    <!--
    <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Markus Lanthaler" .
    <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage> <http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/> .
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Using the <a href="#serialize-rdf-as-json-ld-algorithm">Serialize RDF as JSON-LD algorithm</a>
      a developer could transform this document into expanded JSON-LD:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample Turtle document converted to JSON-LD">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
          { "@value": "Markus Lanthaler" }
        ],

        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Note that the output above could easily be compacted using the technique outlined
      in the previous section. It is also possible to deserialize the JSON-LD document back
      to RDF using the <a href="#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF algorithm</a>.</p>

  <h1>Context Processing Algorithms</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Context Processing Algorithm</h2>

    <p>When processing a JSON-LD data structure, each processing rule is applied
      using information provided by the <a>active context</a>. This
      section describes how to produce an <a>active context</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a>active context</a> contains the active
      <a>term definitions</a> which specify how
      properties and values have to be interpreted as well as the current <a>base IRI</a>,
      the <a>vocabulary mapping</a> and the <a>default language</a>. Each
      <a>term definition</a> consists of an <dfn data-lt="IRI mappings">IRI mapping</dfn>, a boolean
      flag <dfn data-lt="reverse properties">reverse property</dfn>, an optional <dfn data-lt="type mappings">type mapping</dfn>
      or <dfn data-lt="language mappings">language mapping</dfn>, and an optional  <dfn data-lt="container mappings">container mapping</dfn>.
      A <a>term definition</a> can not only be used to map a <a>term</a>
      to an IRI, but also to map a <a>term</a> to a <a>keyword</a>,
      in which case it is referred to as a <dfn data-lt="keyword aliases">keyword alias</dfn>.</p>

    <p>When processing, the <a>active context</a> is initialized
      without any <a>term definitions</a>,
      <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, or <a>default language</a>.
      If a <a>local context</a> is encountered during processing, a new
      <a>active context</a> is created by cloning the existing
      <a>active context</a>. Then the information from the
      <a>local context</a> is merged into the new <a>active context</a>.
      Given that <a>local contexts</a> may contain
      references to remote contexts, this includes their retrieval.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>First we prepare a new <a>active context</a> <em>result</em> by cloning
        the current <a>active context</a>. Then we normalize the form of the passed
        <a>local context</a> to an <a>array</a>.
        <a>Local contexts</a> may be in the form of a
        <a>JSON object</a>, a <a>string</a>, or an <a>array</a> containing
        a combination of the two. Finally we process each <a>context</a> contained
        in the <a>local context</a> <a>array</a> as follows.</p>

      <p>If <a>context</a> is a <a>string</a>, it represents a reference to
        a remote context. We dereference the remote context and replace <a>context</a>
        with the value of the <code>@context</code> key of the top-level object in the
        retrieved JSON-LD document. If there's no such key, an
        <a data-link-for="JsonLdErrorCode">invalid remote context</a>
        has been detected. Otherwise, we process <a>context</a> by recursively using
        this algorithm ensuring that there is no cyclical reference.</p>

      <p>If <a>context</a> is a <a>JSON object</a>, we first update the
        <a>base IRI</a>, the <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, and the
        <a>default language</a> by processing three specific keywords:
        <code>@base</code>, <code>@vocab</code>, and <code>@language</code>.
        These are handled before any other keys in the <a>local context</a> because
        they affect how the other keys are processed. Please note that <code>@base</code> is
        ignored when processing remote contexts.</p>

      <p>Then, for every other key in <a>local context</a>, we update
        the <a>term definition</a> in <em>result</em>. Since
        <a>term definitions</a> in a <a>local context</a>
        may themselves contain <a>terms</a> or
        <a>compact IRIs</a>, we may need to recurse.
        When doing so, we must ensure that there is no cyclical dependency,
        which is an error. After we have processed any
        <a>term definition</a> dependencies,
        we update the current <a>term definition</a>,
        which may be a <a>keyword alias</a>.</p>

      <p>Finally, we return <em>result</em> as the new <a>active context</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>This algorithm specifies how a new <a>active context</a> is updated
        with a <a>local context</a>. The algorithm takes three input variables:
        an <a>active context</a>, a <a>local context</a>, and an  <a>array</a>
        <em>remote contexts</em> which is used to detect cyclical context inclusions.
        If <em>remote contexts</em> is not passed, it is initialized to an empty
        <a>array</a>.</p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>Initialize <em>result</em> to the result of cloning
          <a>active context</a>.</li>
        <li>If <a>local context</a> is not an <a>array</a>,
          set it to an <a>array</a> containing only

              next <em>context</em>. The <a>base IRI</a> of the
              <a>active context</a> is set to the IRI of the currently being processed
              document (which might be different from the currently being processed context),
              if available; otherwise to <code>null</code>. If set, the

    <h2>Create Term Definition</h2>

    <p>This algorithm is called from the
      <a href="#context-processing-algorithm">Context Processing algorithm</a>
      to create a <a>term definition</a> in the <a>active context</a>
      for a <a>term</a> being processed in a <a>local context</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p><a>term definitions</a> are created by
        parsing the information in the given <a>local context</a> for the
        given <a>term</a>. If the given <a>term</a> is a
        <a>compact IRI</a>, it may omit an <a>IRI mapping</a> by
        depending on its <a>prefix</a> having its own
        <a>term definition</a>. If the <a>prefix</a> is
        a key in the <a>local context</a>, then its <a>term definition</a>
        must first be created, through recursion, before continuing. Because a
        <a>term definition</a> can depend on other
        <a>term definitions</a>, a mechanism must
        be used to detect cyclical dependencies. The solution employed here
        uses a map, <em>defined</em>, that keeps track of whether or not a
        <a>term</a> has been defined or is currently in the process of
        being defined. This map is checked before any recursion is attempted.</p>

      <p>After all dependencies for a <a>term</a> have been defined, the rest of
        the information in the <a>local context</a> for the given
        <a>term</a> is taken into account, creating the appropriate
        <a>IRI mapping</a>, <a>container mapping</a>, and
        <a>type mapping</a> or <a>language mapping</a> for the
        <a>term</a>.</p>

    <h2>IRI Expansion</h2>

    <p>In JSON-LD documents, some keys and values may represent
      <a>IRIs</a>. This section defines an algorithm for
      transforming a <a>string</a> that represents an <a>IRI</a> into
      an <a>absolute IRI</a> or <a>blank node identifier</a>.
      It also covers transforming <a>keyword aliases</a>
      into <a>keywords</a>.</p>

    <p><a>IRI</a> expansion may occur during context processing or during
      any of the other JSON-LD algorithms. If IRI expansion occurs during context
      processing, then the <a>local context</a> and its related <em>defined</em>
      map from the <a href="#context-processing-algorithm">Context Processing algorithm</a>
      are passed to this algorithm. This allows for <a>term definition</a>
      dependencies to be processed via the
      <a href="#create-term-definition">Create Term Definition algorithm</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>In order to expand <em>value</em> to an <a>absolute IRI</a>, we must
        first determine if it is <code>null</code>, a <a>term</a>, a
        <a>keyword alias</a>, or some form of <a>IRI</a>. Based on what
        we find, we handle the specific kind of expansion; for example, we expand
        a <a>keyword alias</a> to a <a>keyword</a> and a <a>term</a>
        to an <a>absolute IRI</a> according to its <a>IRI mapping</a>
        in the <a>active context</a>. While inspecting <em>value</em> we
        may also find that we need to create <a>term definition</a>
        dependencies because we're running this algorithm during context processing.
        We can tell whether or not we're running during context processing by
        checking <a>local context</a> against <code>null</code>.
        We know we need to create a <a>term definition</a> in the
        <a>active context</a> when <em>value</em> is
        a key in the <a>local context</a> and the <em>defined</em> map
        does not have a key for <em>value</em> with an associated value of
        <code>true</code>. The <em>defined</em> map is used during
        <a href="#context-processing-algorithm">Context Processing</a> to keep track of
        which <a>terms</a> have already been defined or are
        in the process of being defined. We create a
        <a>term definition</a> by using the
        <a href="#create-term-definition">Create Term Definition algorithm</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>The algorithm takes two required and four optional input variables. The
        required inputs are an <a>active context</a> and a <em>value</em>
        to be expanded. The optional inputs are two flags,
        <em>document relative</em> and <em>vocab</em>, that specifying
        whether <em>value</em> can be interpreted as a <a>relative IRI</a>
        against the document's base <a>IRI</a> or the
        <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a>
        <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, respectively, and
        a <a>local context</a> and a map <em>defined</em> to be used when
        this algorithm is used during <a href="#context-processing-algorithm">Context Processing</a>.
        If not passed, the two flags are set to <code>false</code> and
        <a>local context</a> and <em>defined</em> are initialized to <code>null</code>.</p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>If <em>value</em> is a <a>keyword</a> or <code>null</code>,
          return <em>value</em> as is.</li>
        <li>If <a>local context</a> is not <code>null</code>, it contains
          a key that equals <em>value</em>, and the value associated with the key
          that equals <em>value</em> in <em>defined</em> is not <code>true</code>,
          invoke the <a href="#create-term-definition">Create Term Definition algorithm</a>,

    <h2>Expansion Algorithm</h2>

    <p>This algorithm expands a JSON-LD document, such that all <a>context</a>
      definitions are removed, all <a>terms</a> and
      <a>compact IRIs</a> are expanded to
      <a>absolute IRIs</a>,
      <a>blank node identifiers</a>, or
      <a>keywords</a> and all
      <a>JSON-LD values</a> are expressed in
      <a>arrays</a> in <a>expanded form</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Starting with its root <em>element</em>, we can process the
        JSON-LD document recursively, until we have a fully
        <a>expanded</a> <em>result</em>. When
        <a>expanding</a> an <em>element</em>, we can treat
        each one differently according to its type, in order to break down the
        problem:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>If the <em>element</em> is <code>null</code>, there is nothing
          to expand.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if <em>element</em> is a <a>scalar</a>, we expand it
          according to the <a href="#value-expansion">Value Expansion algorithm</a>.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the <em>element</em> is an <a>array</a>, then we expand
          each of its items recursively and return them in a new
          <a>array</a>.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, <em>element</em> is a <a>JSON object</a>. We expand
          each of its keys, adding them to our <em>result</em>, and then we expand
          each value for each key recursively. Some of the keys will be
          <a>terms</a> or
          <a>compact IRIs</a> and others will be
          <a>keywords</a> or simply ignored because
          they do not have definitions in the <a>context</a>. Any
          <a>IRIs</a> will be expanded using the
          <a href="#iri-expansion">IRI Expansion algorithm</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Finally, after ensuring <em>result</em> is in an <a>array</a>,
        we return <em>result</em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>The algorithm takes three input variables: an <a>active context</a>,
        an <a>active property</a>, and an <em>element</em> to be expanded.
        To begin, the <a>active property</a> is set to <code>null</code>,
        and <em>element</em> is set to the <a>JSON-LD input</a>.</p>

      <p>The algorithm also performs processing steps specific to expanding
        a <a>JSON-LD Frame</a>. For a <a>frame</a>, the <code>@id</code> and
        <code>@type</code> properties can accept an array of <a>IRIs</a> or
        an empty <a>dictionary</a>. The properties of a <a>value object</a> can also
        accept an <a>array</a> of <a>strings</a>, or an empty <a>dictionary</a>.
        Framing also uses additional keyword properties:
        (<code>@explicit</code>, <code>@default</code>,
        <code>@embed</code>, <code>@explicit</code>, <code>@omitDefault</code>, or
        <code>@requireAll</code>) which are preserved through expansion.
        Special processing for a <a>JSON-LD Frame</a> is invoked when the
        <a data-link-for="JsonLdOptions">processingMode</a> API option is set
        to <code>json-ld-1.1-expand-frame</code>, indicated in the algorithm
        with the <code>frame expansion</code> flag.</p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>If <em>element</em> is <code>null</code>, return <code>null</code>.</li>
        <li>If <em>element</em> is a <a>scalar</a>,
          <ol class="algorithm">
            <li>If <a>active property</a> is <code>null</code> or <code>@graph</code>,

  <h1>Compaction Algorithms</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Compaction Algorithm</h2>

    <p>This algorithm compacts a JSON-LD document, such that the given
      <a>context</a> is applied. This must result in shortening
      any applicable <a>IRIs</a> to
      <a>terms</a> or
      <a>compact IRIs</a>, any applicable
      <a>keywords</a> to
      <a>keyword aliases</a>, and
      any applicable <a>JSON-LD values</a>
      expressed in <a>expanded form</a> to simple values such as
      <a>strings</a> or
      <a>numbers</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Starting with its root <em>element</em>, we can process the
        JSON-LD document recursively, until we have a fully
        <a>compacted</a> <em>result</em>. When
        <a>compacting</a> an <em>element</em>, we can treat
        each one differently according to its type, in order to break down the
        problem:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>If the <em>element</em> is a <a>scalar</a>, it is
          already in <a>compacted form</a>, so we simply return it.</li>
        <li>If the <em>element</em> is an <a>array</a>, we compact
          each of its items recursively and return them in a new
          <a>array</a>.</li>
        <li>Otherwise <em>element</em> is a <a>JSON object</a>. The value
          of each key in element is compacted recursively. Some of the keys will be
          compacted, using the <a href="#iri-compaction">IRI Compaction algorithm</a>,
          to <a>terms</a> or <a>compact IRIs</a>
          and others will be compacted from <a>keywords</a> to
          <a>keyword aliases</a> or simply left
          unchanged because they do not have definitions in the <a>context</a>.
          Values will be converted to <a>compacted form</a> via the
          <a href="#value-compaction">Value Compaction algorithm</a>. Some data
          will be reshaped based on <a>container mapping</a>
          specified in the context such as <code>@index</code> or <code>@language</code>
          maps.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The final output is a <a>JSON object</a> with an <code>@context</code>
        key, if a non-empty <a>context</a> was given, where the <a>JSON object</a>
        is either <em>result</em> or a wrapper for it where <em>result</em> appears
        as the value of an (aliased) <code>@graph</code> key because <em>result</em>
        contained two or more items in an <a>array</a>.</p>

    <h2>Inverse Context Creation</h2>

    <p>When there is more than one <a>term</a> that could be chosen
      to compact an <a>IRI</a>, it has to be ensured that the <a>term</a>
      selection is both deterministic and represents the most context-appropriate
      choice whilst taking into consideration algorithmic complexity.</p>

    <p>In order to make <a>term</a> selections, the concept of an
      <a>inverse context</a> is introduced. An <dfn>inverse context</dfn>
      is essentially a reverse lookup table that maps
      <a>container mapping</a>,
      <a>type mappings</a>, and
      <a>language mappings</a> to a simple
      <a>term</a> for a given <a>active context</a>. A
      <a>inverse context</a> only needs to be generated for an
      <a>active context</a> if it is being used for <a>compaction</a>.</p>

    <p>To make use of an <a>inverse context</a>, a list of preferred
      <a>container mapping</a> and the
      <a>type mapping</a> or <a>language mapping</a> are gathered
      for a particular value associated with an <a>IRI</a>. These parameters
      are then fed to the <a href="#term-selection">Term Selection algorithm</a>,
      which will find the <a>term</a> that most appropriately
      matches the value's mappings.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>To create an <a>inverse context</a> for a given
        <a>active context</a>, each <a>term</a> in the
        <a>active context</a> is visited, ordered by length, shortest
        first (ties are broken by choosing the lexicographically least
        <a>term</a>). For each <a>term</a>, an entry is added to
        the <a>inverse context</a> for each possible combination of
        <a>container mapping</a> and <a>type mapping</a>
        or <a>language mapping</a> that would legally match the
        <a>term</a>. Illegal matches include differences between a
        value's <a>type mapping</a> or <a>language mapping</a> and
        that of the <a>term</a>. If a <a>term</a> has no
        <a>container mapping</a>, <a>type mapping</a>, or
        <a>language mapping</a> (or some combination of these), then it
        will have an entry in the <a>inverse context</a> using the special
        key <code>@none</code>. This allows the
        <a href="#term-selection">Term Selection algorithm</a> to fall back
        to choosing more generic <a>terms</a> when a more
        specifically-matching <a>term</a> is not available for a particular
        <a>IRI</a> and value combination.</p>

    <h2>IRI Compaction</h2>

    <p>This algorithm compacts an <a>IRI</a> to a <a>term</a> or
      <a>compact IRI</a>, or a <a>keyword</a> to a
      <a>keyword alias</a>. A value that is associated with the
      <a>IRI</a> may be passed in order to assist in selecting the most
      context-appropriate <a>term</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>If the passed <a>IRI</a> is <code>null</code>, we simply
        return <code>null</code>. Otherwise, we first try to find a <a>term</a>
        that the <a>IRI</a> or <a>keyword</a> can be compacted to if
        it is relative to <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a>
        <a>vocabulary mapping</a>. In order to select the most appropriate
        <a>term</a>, we may have to collect information about the passed
        <em>value</em>. This information includes which
        <a>container mapping</a>
        would be preferred for expressing the <em>value</em>, and what its
        <a>type mapping</a> or <a>language mapping</a> is. For
        <a data-lt="list object">JSON-LD lists</a>, the <a>type mapping</a>
        or <a>language mapping</a> will be chosen based on the most
        specific values that work for all items in the list. Once this
        information is gathered, it is passed to the
        <a href="#term-selection">Term Selection algorithm</a>, which will
        return the most appropriate <a>term</a> to use.</p>

      <p>If no <a>term</a> was found that could be used to compact the
        <a>IRI</a>, an attempt is made to compact the <a>IRI</a> using the
        <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a> <a>vocabulary mapping</a>,
        if there is one. If the <a>IRI</a> could not be compacted, an
        attempt is made to find a <a>compact IRI</a>. If there is no
        appropriate <a>compact IRI</a>, the <a>IRI</a> is
        transformed to a <a>relative IRI</a> using the document's
        <a>base IRI</a>. Finally, if the <a>IRI</a> or
        <a>keyword</a> still could not be compacted, it is returned
        as is.</p>

      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>This algorithm takes three required inputs and three optional inputs.
        The required inputs are an <a>active context</a>, an <a>inverse context</a>,
        and the <em>iri</em> to be compacted. The optional inputs are a <em>value</em> associated
        with the <em>iri</em>, a <em>vocab</em> flag which specifies whether the
        passed <em>iri</em> should be compacted using the
        <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a>
        <a>vocabulary mapping</a>, and a <em>reverse</em> flag which specifies whether
        a <a>reverse property</a> is being compacted. If not passed, <em>value</em> is set to
        <code>null</code> and <em>vocab</em> and <em>reverse</em> are both set to
        <code>false</code>.</p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>If <em>iri</em> is <code>null</code>, return <code>null</code>.</li>
        <li>If <em>vocab</em> is <code>true</code> and <em>iri</em> is a

    <p>This algorithm, invoked via the <a href="#iri-compaction">IRI Compaction algorithm</a>,
      makes use of an <a data-lt="active context">active context's</a>

      used to <a>compact</a> an <a>IRI</a>. Other
      information about a value associated with the <a>IRI</a> is given,
      including which <a>container mapping</a>
      and which <a>type mapping</a> or <a>language mapping</a> would
      be best used to express the value.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>The <a data-lt="inverse context">inverse context's</a> entry for
        the <a>IRI</a> will be first searched according to the preferred
        <a>container mapping</a>, in the order

        without a <a>container mapping</a> that matches the given
        <a>type mapping</a> or <a>language mapping</a> is selected. If

    <h2>Value Compaction</h2>

    <p><a>Expansion</a> transforms all values into <a>expanded form</a>
      in JSON-LD. This algorithm performs the opposite operation, transforming
      a value into <dfn data-lt="compact form">compacted form</dfn>. This algorithm compacts a
      value according to the <a>term definition</a> in the given
      <a>active context</a> that is associated with the value's associated
      <a>active property</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>The <em>value</em> to compact has either an <code>@id</code> or an
        <code>@value</code> member.</p>

      <p>For the former case, if the <a>type mapping</a> of
        <a>active property</a> is set to <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code>

        using the <a href="#iri-compaction">IRI Compaction algorithm</a>
        to compact the value associated with the <code>@id</code> member.
        Otherwise, <em>value</em> cannot be compacted and is returned as is.</p>

      <p>For the latter case, it might be possible to compact <em>value</em>
        just into the value associated with the <code>@value</code> member.
        This can be done if the <a>active property</a> has a matching

        is either no <code>@index</code> member or the <a>container mapping</a>

  <h1>Flattening Algorithms</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Flattening Algorithm</h2>

    <p>This algorithm flattens an expanded JSON-LD document by collecting all
      properties of a <a>node</a> in a single <a>JSON object</a>
      and labeling all <a>blank nodes</a> with
      <a>blank node identifiers</a>.
      This resulting uniform shape of the document, may drastically simplify
      the code required to process JSON-LD data in certain applications.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>First, a <em>node map</em> is generated using the
        <a href="#node-map-generation">Node Map Generation algorithm</a>
        which collects all properties of a <a>node</a> in a single
        <a>JSON object</a>. In the next step, the <em>node map</em> is
        converted to a JSON-LD document in
        <a href="../json-ld/#flattened-document-form" class="externalDFN">flattened document form</a>.
        Finally, if a <a>context</a> has been passed, the flattened document
        is compacted using the <a href="#compaction-algorithm">Compaction algorithm</a>
        before being returned.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>The algorithm takes two input variables, an <em>element</em> to flatten and
        an optional <em>context</em> used to compact the flattened document. If not
        passed, <em>context</em> is set to <code>null</code>.</p>

      <p>This algorithm generates new <a>blank node identifiers</a>
        and relabels existing <a>blank node identifiers</a>.
        The used <a href="#generate-blank-node-identifier">Generate Blank Node Identifier algorithm</a>
        keeps an <em>identifier map</em> and a <em>counter</em> to ensure consistent
        relabeling and avoid collisions. Thus, before this algorithm is run,
        the <em>identifier map</em> is reset and the <em>counter</em> is initialized
        to <code>0</code>.</p>

    <h2>Node Map Generation</h2>

    <p>This algorithm creates a <a>JSON object</a> <em>node map</em> holding an indexed

      represented in the passed expanded document. All <a>nodes</a> that are not
      uniquely identified by an IRI get assigned a (new) <a>blank node identifier</a>.
      The resulting <em>node map</em> will have a member for every graph in the document whose
      value is another object with a member for every <a>node</a> represented in the document.
      The default graph is stored under the <code>@default</code> member, all other graphs are
      stored under their <a>graph name</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>The algorithm recursively runs over an expanded JSON-LD document to
        collect all <a>properties</a> of a <a>node</a>

    <h2>Generate Blank Node Identifier</h2>

    <p>This algorithm is used to generate new
      <a>blank node identifiers</a> or to
      relabel an existing <a>blank node identifier</a> to avoid collision
      by the introduction of new ones.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>The simplest case is if there exists already a <a>blank node identifier</a>
        in the <em>identifier map</em> for the passed <em>identifier</em>, in which
        case it is simply returned. Otherwise, a new <a>blank node identifier</a>
        is generated by concatenating the string <code>_:b</code> and the
        <em>counter</em>. If the passed <em>identifier</em> is not <code>null</code>,
        an entry is created in the <em>identifier map</em> associating the
        <em>identifier</em> with the <a>blank node identifier</a>. Finally,
        the <em>counter</em> is increased by one and the new
        <a>blank node identifier</a> is returned.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>The algorithm takes a single input variable <em>identifier</em> which may

        keep an <em>identifier map</em> to relabel existing
        <a>blank node identifiers</a>
        consistently and a <em>counter</em> to generate new
        <a>blank node identifiers</a>. The
        <em>counter</em> is initialized to <code>0</code> by default.</p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>If <em>identifier</em> is not <code>null</code> and has an entry in the
          <em>identifier map</em>, return the mapped identifier.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, generate a new <a>blank node identifier</a> by concatenating
          the string <code>_:b</code> and <em>counter</em>.</li>
        <li>Increment <em>counter</em> by <code>1</code>.</li>
        <li>If <em>identifier</em> is not <code>null</code>, create a new entry

    <h2>Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF algorithm</h2>

    <p>This algorithm deserializes a JSON-LD document to an <a>RDF dataset</a>.
      Please note that RDF does not allow a <a>blank node</a> to be used
      as a <a>property</a>, while JSON-LD does.  Therefore, by default
      RDF triples that would have contained blank nodes as properties are
      discarded when interpreting JSON-LD as RDF.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>The JSON-LD document is expanded and converted to a <em>node map</em> using the
        <a href="#node-map-generation">Node Map Generation algorithm</a>.
        This allows each graph represented within the document to be
        extracted and flattened, making it easier to process each
        <a>node object</a>. Each graph from the <em>node map</em>
        is processed to extract <a>RDF triple</a>,
        to which any (non-default) graph name is applied to create an
        <a>RDF dataset</a>. Each <a>node object</a> in the
        <em>node map</em> has an <code>@id</code> member which corresponds to the
        <a>RDF subject</a>, the other members
        represent <a>RDF predicates</a>. Each
        member value is either an <a>IRI</a> or
        <a>blank node identifier</a> or can be transformed to an
        <a>RDF literal</a>
        to generate an <a>RDF triple</a>. <a>Lists</a>
        are transformed into an
        <a>RDF collection</a>
        using the <a href="#list-to-rdf-conversion">List to RDF Conversion algorithm.</a></p>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>The algorithm takes a JSON-LD document <em>element</em> and returns an
        <a>RDF dataset</a>. Unless the <em>produce generalized RDF</em> flag
        is set to <code>true</code>, <a>RDF triple</a>
        containing a <a>blank node</a> <a>predicate</a>
        are excluded from output.</p>

      <p>This algorithm generates new <a>blank node identifiers</a>
        and relabels existing <a>blank node identifiers</a>.
        The used <a href="#generate-blank-node-identifier">Generate Blank Node Identifier algorithm</a>
        keeps an <em>identifier map</em> and a <em>counter</em> to ensure consistent
        relabeling and avoid collisions. Thus, before this algorithm is run,
        the <em>identifier map</em> is reset and the <em>counter</em> is initialized

    <h3>Object to RDF Conversion</h3>

    <p>This algorithm takes a <a>node object</a> or <a>value object</a>
      and transforms it into an
      <a>RDF resource</a>
      to be used as the <a>object</a> of an <a>RDF triple</a>. If a
      <a>node object</a> containing a <a>relative IRI</a> is passed to

    <h2>Data Round Tripping</h2>

    <p>When <a href="#deserialize-json-ld-to-rdf-algorithm">deserializing JSON-LD to RDF</a>
      JSON-native <a>numbers</a> are automatically
      type-coerced to <code>xsd:integer</code> or <code>xsd:double</code>
      depending on whether the <a>number</a> has a non-zero fractional part
      or not (the result of a modulo&#8209;1 operation), the boolean values
      <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are coerced to <code>xsd:boolean</code>,
      and <a>strings</a> are coerced to <code>xsd:string</code>.
      The numeric or boolean values themselves are converted to
      <dfn>canonical lexical form</dfn>, i.e., a deterministic string
      representation as defined in [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]].</p>

    <p>The <a>canonical lexical form</a> of an <em>integer</em>, i.e., a
      <a>number</a> with no non-zero fractional part or a <a>number</a>
      coerced to <code>xsd:integer</code>, is a finite-length sequence of decimal
      digits (<code>0-9</code>) with an optional leading minus sign; leading
      zeros are prohibited. In JavaScript, implementers can use the following
      snippet of code to convert an integer to
      <a>canonical lexical form</a>:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample integer serialization implementation in JavaScript">
    <!--
    (value).toFixed(0).toString()
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The <a>canonical lexical form</a> of a <em>double</em>, i.e., a
      <a>number</a> with a non-zero fractional part or a <a>number</a>
      coerced to <code>xsd:double</code>, consists of a mantissa followed by the
      character <code>E</code>, followed by an exponent. The mantissa is a
      decimal number and the exponent is an integer. Leading zeros and a
      preceding plus sign (<code>+</code>) are prohibited in the exponent.
      If the exponent is zero, it is indicated by <code>E0</code>. For the
      mantissa, the preceding optional plus sign is prohibited and the
      decimal point is required. Leading and trailing zeros are prohibited
      subject to the following: number representations must be normalized
      such that there is a single digit which is non-zero to the left of
      the decimal point and at least a single digit to the right of the
      decimal point unless the value being represented is zero. The
      canonical representation for zero is <code>0.0E0</code>.
      <code>xsd:double</code>'s value space is defined by the IEEE
      double-precision 64-bit floating point type [[!IEEE-754-2008]] whereas
      the value space of JSON <a>numbers</a> is not
      specified; when deserializing JSON-LD to RDF the mantissa is rounded to
      15&nbsp;digits after the decimal point. In JavaScript, implementers
      can use the following snippet of code to convert a double to
      <a>canonical lexical form</a>:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample floating point number serialization implementation in JavaScript">
    <!--
    (value).toExponential(15).replace(/(\d)0*e\+?/,'$1E')
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The <a>canonical lexical form</a> of the <em>boolean</em>
      values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are the strings
      <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

    <p>When JSON-native <a>numbers</a> are deserialized
      to RDF, lossless data round-tripping cannot be guaranteed, as rounding
      errors might occur. When
      <a href="#serialize-rdf-as-json-ld-algorithm">serializing RDF as JSON-LD</a>,
      similar rounding errors might occur. Furthermore, the datatype or the lexical
      representation might be lost. An <code>xsd:double</code> with a value
      of <code>2.0</code> will, e.g., result in an <code>xsd:integer</code>
      with a value of <code>2</code> in <a>canonical lexical form</a>
      when converted from RDF to JSON-LD and back to RDF. It is important
      to highlight that in practice it might be impossible to losslessly
      convert an <code>xsd:integer</code> to a <a>number</a> because
      its value space is not limited. While the JSON specification [[!RFC7159]]
      does not limit the value space of <a>numbers</a>
      either, concrete implementations typically do have a limited value
      space.</p>

    <p>To ensure lossless round-tripping the
      <a href="#serialize-rdf-as-json-ld-algorithm">Serialize RDF as JSON-LD algorithm</a>
      specifies a <em>use native types</em> flag which controls whether
      <a>RDF literals</a>
      with a <a>datatype IRI</a>
      equal to <code>xsd:integer</code>, <code>xsd:double</code>, or
      <code>xsd:boolean</code> are converted to their JSON-native
      counterparts. If the <em>use native types</em> flag is set to
      <code>false</code>, all literals remain in their original string
      representation.</p>

    <p>Some JSON serializers, such as PHP's native implementation in some versions,
      backslash-escape the forward slash character. For example, the value
      <code>http://example.com/</code> would be serialized as <code>http:\/\/example.com\/</code>.
      This is problematic as other JSON parsers might not understand those escaping characters.
      There is no need to backslash-escape forward slashes in JSON-LD. To aid
      interoperability between JSON-LD processors, forward slashes MUST NOT be
      backslash-escaped.</p>

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to convert

    <p>The <a>JsonLdProcessor</a> interface is the high-level programming structure
      that developers use to access the JSON-LD transformation methods.</p>

    <p>It is important to highlight that implementations do not modify the input parameters.
