<p>JSON-LD Connect is a way of turning a JSON-LD document into a live graph of
interconnected and indexed objects.</p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
<p>This document is an experimental work in progress.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  A JSON-LD document is a representation of a directed graph. A single
  directed graph can have many different serializations, each expressing
  exactly the same information. Developers wanting to work with interconnected
  <tref>JSON object</tref>s,
  can use the connect algorithm described here to "stich together"
  <tref>node definition</tref>s
  and creating an index of important values mapped to each node. This enables
  navigation between node definitions via interlinking keys (representing arcs
  in graph nomenclature).
</p>
<p>
  Technically, connect works by replacing each <tref>node reference</tref> in
  the input data with a real, programmatic object reference, to one, merged
  node definition. This results in the creation of a simple in-memory graph.
</p>
<p>
  Out of the box, the connect process creates an index mapping node
  <code>@id</code> values to the <tref>node definition</tref>. It is also
  possible to configure the process to create additional indexes, as well as
  adding a local <tref>reverse key map</tref> to each node definition.
</p>

<h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

<p>
This document is a detailed specification for Linked Data in JSON. The document
is primarily intended for the following audiences:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software developers that want to implement processors and APIs for
  JSON-LD.</li>
  <li>Web developers who want to navigate JSON-LD documents as interconnected
  nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
JSON, which is detailed in [[!RFC4627]]. You must also understand the
JSON-LD Syntax [[!JSON-LD]], which is the base syntax used by all of the
algorithms in this document,
and the JSON-LD API [[!JSON-LD-API]]. To understand the API and how it is
intended to operate  in a programming environment, it is useful to have working
knowledge of the JavaScript programming language [[ECMA-262]] and
WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]]. To understand how JSON-LD maps to RDF, it is helpful to be
familiar with the basic RDF concepts [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]].</p>

  <h3>General Terminology</h3>

  <p class="issue">The intent of the Working Group and the Editors of this
    specification is to eventually align terminology used in this document
    with the terminology used in the RDF Concepts document to the extent to
    which it makes sense to do so. In general, if there is an analogue to
    terminology used in this document in the RDF Concepts document, the
    preference is to use the terminology in the RDF Concepts document.
  </p>

  <p>The following is an explanation of the general terminology used in this
    document:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><tdef>JSON object</tdef></dt>
    <dd>An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding zero or
      more name-value pairs. A name is a <tref>string</tref>. A single colon comes after
      each name, separating the name from the value. A single comma separates a value
      from a following name. The names within an object SHOULD be unique.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>array</tdef></dt>
    <dd>An array is represented as square brackets surrounding zero or more
      values that are separated by commas.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>string</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode (UTF-8) characters,
      wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes (if necessary). A
      character is represented as a single character string.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>number</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A number is similar to that used in most programming languages, except
      that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used and that leading
      zeros are not allowed.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>true</tdef> and <tdef>false</tdef></dt>
    <dd>Values that are used to express one of two possible boolean states.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>null</tdef></dt>
    <dd>The use of the <tref>null</tref> value within JSON-LD is used to ignore or reset values.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>keyword</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A JSON key that is specific to JSON-LD, specified in the JSON-LD Syntax specification [[!JSON-LD]]
      in the section titled <cite><a href="../json-ld/#syntax-tokens-and-keywords">Syntax Tokens and Keywords</a></cite>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>context</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A a set of rules for interpreting a JSON-LD document as specified in
      <cite><a href="../json-ld/#the-context">The Context</a></cite> of the [[JSON-LD]] specification.</dd>
    <dt><tdef><abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr></tdef></dt>
    <dd>An Internationalized Resource Identifier as described in [[!RFC3987]].</dd>
    <dt><tdef>Linked Data</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A technique for creating a network of inter-connected data across different documents and Web sites.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>JSON-LD graph</tdef></dt>
    <dd>An unordered labeled directed graph, where <tref title="node">nodes</tref> are
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> or <tref title="Blank Node">Blank Nodes</tref>, or other values.
      A <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref> is a generalized representation of a
      <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a></cite>
      as defined in [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]].</dd>
    <dt><tdef>named graph</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref> that is identified by an <tref>IRI</tref>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>graph name</tdef></dt>
    <dd>The <tref>IRI</tref> identifying a <tref>named graph</tref>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>default graph</tdef></dt>
    <dd>When executing an algorithm, the graph where data should be placed
      if a <tref>named graph</tref> is not specified.</dd>

    <dd>A piece of information that is represented in a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>node definition</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A <tref>JSON object</tref> used to represent a <tref>node</tref> and
      one or more properties of that node. A <tref>JSON object</tref> is a
      node definition if it does not contain the keys <code>@value</code>,
      <code>@list</code> or <code>@set</code> and it has one or more keys
      other than <code>@id</code>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>node reference</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A <tref>JSON object</tref> used to reference a node having only the
      <code>@id</code> key.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>blank node</tdef></dt>
    <dd>A <tref>node</tref> in a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref> that does not contain a de-referenceable
      identifier because it is either ephemeral in nature or does not contain information that needs to be
      linked to from outside of the JSON-LD graph. A blank node is assigned an identifier starting with
      the prefix <code>_:</code>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>property</tdef></dt>
    <dd>The <tref>IRI</tref> label of an edge in a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>.</dd>

    <dd>A piece of information that contains four items; a <tref>subject</tref>, a <tref>property</tref>,
      an <tref>object</tref>, and a <tref>graph name</tref>.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>literal</tdef></dt>

<h3>Connect Algorithm</h3>

<p>
  Create an <code>idMap</code> and a <code>typeMap</code>, being the
  <tref>map of result objects</tref> and <tref>type map</tref> of the
  <tref>connected output</tref> respectively.
</p>

<p>For each object, do the following series of steps:</p>

<ol class="algorithm">
  <li>
    If the object has a key whose resolved meaning is <code>@id</code>,
    find an existing object indexed by that id from the <code>idMap</code>. If
    one is found, use that as the <tref>current result object</tref>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise (on no key or no existing), create a new object and use that as
    the result object.
  </li>
  <li>
    For each key, value pair in the current object, do the following:
    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>
        If the resolved key meaning is <code>@id</code>, add the result object
        under that key to the <code>idMap</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the resolved key meaning is <code>@type</code>, and the current
        object has no key whose resolved meaning is <code>@value</code>, get or
        add an array for the type value in the <code>typeMap</code>. Append the
        result object to that array.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the value is an object, create a new value by using the result of
        running these steps recursively with the value as input.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, if the value is an array, create a new array. Then apply
        these steps recursively to each object in the array, appending each
        result to the new array.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, use the value as the new value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the key and the new value to the result object.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Return the result object.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If the <code>@rev</code> flag is used, pass the current key (called reverse
   link) and current object (called linking object) to each recursive call in
   the process above. At the end of the process, get or create a
   <em>revMap</em> from the current object. Get or create a list for the
   reverse link key from the revMap, and append the linking object to that.
   Then set that revMap on the current object.
</p>

<p>
  The resulting <code>idMap</code> and <code>typeMap</code> are added to the
  final <tref>connected output</tref>.
</p>

<p class="issue">
  This algorithm is a work in progress. It is currently undefined whether the
  creation of typeMaps and revMaps should be optional. It is also still
  undefined which keys will label these in the connected output.
