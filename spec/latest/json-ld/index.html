  <p>JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format.
    This specification defines JSON-LD, a JSON-based format to serialize
    Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed
    systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from
    JSON to JSON-LD.
    It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based
    programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to
    store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.</p>

  <p>This document has been developed by the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data W3C Community Group</a>.
    The document has been transferred to the RDF Working Group for review, improvement,
    and publication along the Recommendation track. The specification has undergone
    significant development, review, and changes during the course of several years.</p>

    of demonstrating the features described in this document.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]] is a way to create a network of
   standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and
   Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data,
   and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on
   different sites across the Web.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD is a lightweight syntax to serialize Linked Data in
    JSON [[!RFC4627]]. Its design allows existing JSON to be interpreted as
    Linked Data with minimal changes. JSON-LD is primarily intended to be a
    way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
    interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. Since
    JSON-LD is 100% compatible with JSON, the large number of JSON parsers and libraries
    available today can be reused. In addition to all the features JSON provides,
    JSON-LD introduces:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a universal identifier mechanism for <tref title="JSON object">JSON objects</tref>
      via the use of <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>,</li>
    <li>a way to disambiguate keys shared among different JSON documents by mapping
      them to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> via a <tref>context</tref>,</li>
    <li>a mechanism in which a value in a <tref>JSON object</tref> may refer
      to a <tref>JSON object</tref> on a different site on the Web,</li>
    <li>the ability to annotate <tref title="string">strings</tref> with their language,</li>
    <li>a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates and times,</li>
    <li>and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social
      network, in a single document.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   JSON-LD is designed to be usable directly as JSON, with no knowledge of RDF
   [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. It is also designed to be usable as RDF, if desired, for
   use with other Linked Data technologies like SPARQL. Developers who
   require any of the facilities listed above or need to serialize an RDF Graph
   or RDF Dataset in a JSON-based syntax will find JSON-LD of interest. People
   intending to use JSON-LD with RDF tools will find it can be used as another
   RDF syntax, like Turtle [[TURTLE]]. Complete details of how JSON-LD relates
   to RDF are in section <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The syntax is designed to not disturb already
   deployed systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth upgrade path from
   JSON to JSON-LD. Since the shape of such data varies wildly, JSON-LD
   features mechanisms to reshape documents into a deterministic structure
   which simplifies their processing.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for a serialization of Linked
      Data in JSON. The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to encode Linked Data in a variety of
        programming languages that can use JSON</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to convert existing JSON to JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        language syntax for JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement processors and APIs for
        JSON-LD</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to generate or consume Linked Data,
        an RDF graph, or an RDF Dataset in a JSON syntax</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A companion document, the JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification
      [[JSON-LD-API]], specifies how to work with JSON-LD at a higher level by
      providing a standard library interface for common JSON-LD operations.</p>

    <p>To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
      JSON, which is detailed in [[!RFC4627]].</p>

    <p>This document almost exclusively uses the term IRI
    (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#internationalized-resource-identifier">Internationalized Resource Indicator</a>)
    when discussing hyperlinks. Many Web developers are more familiar with the
    URL (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#uniform-resource-locator">Uniform Resource Locator</a>)
    terminology. The document also uses, albeit rarely, the URI
    (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#uniform-resource-identifier">Uniform Resource Indicator</a>)
    terminology. While these terms are often used interchangeably among
    technical communities, they do have important distinctions from one
    another and the specification goes to great lengths to try and use the
    proper terminology at all times.
    </p>

<section class="informative">
  <h1>Design Goals and Rationale</h1>

  <p>JSON-LD satisfies the following design goals:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Simplicity</dt>
   <dd>No extra processors or software libraries are necessary to use JSON-LD
     in its most basic form. The language provides developers with a very easy
     learning curve. Developers only need to know JSON and two
     <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> (<code>@context</code>
     and <code>@id</code>) to use the basic functionality in JSON-LD.</dd>
   <dt>Compatibility</dt>
   <dd>A JSON-LD document is always a valid JSON document. This ensures that
    all of the standard JSON libraries work seamlessly with JSON-LD documents.</dd>
   <dt>Expressiveness</dt>
   <dd>The syntax serializes directed graphs. This ensures that almost
    every real world data model can be expressed.</dd>
   <dt>Terseness</dt>
   <dd>The JSON-LD syntax is very terse and human readable, requiring as
    little effort as possible from the developer.</dd>
   <dt>Zero Edits, most of the time</dt>
   <dd>JSON-LD ensures a smooth and simple transition from existing
     JSON-based systems. In many cases,
     zero edits to the JSON document and the addition of one line to the HTTP response
     should suffice (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>).
     This allows organizations that have
     already deployed large JSON-based infrastructure to use JSON-LD's features
     in a way that is not disruptive to their day-to-day operations and is
     transparent to their current customers. However, there are times where
     mapping JSON to a graph representation is a complex undertaking.
     In these instances, rather than extending JSON-LD to support
     esoteric use cases, we chose not to support the use case. While Zero
     Edits is a design goal, it is not always possible without adding
     great complexity to the language. JSON-LD focuses on simplicity when
     possible.</dd>
    <dt>Usable as RDF</dt>
    <dd>JSON-LD is usable by developers as
      idiomatic JSON, with no need to understand RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
      JSON-LD is also usable as RDF, so people intending to use JSON-LD
      with RDF tools will find it can be used like any other RDF syntax.
      Complete details of how JSON-LD relates to RDF are in section
      <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</dd>

  <h1>Terminology</h1>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>General Terminology</h2>

    <p>This document uses the following terms as defined in JSON [[!RFC4627]]. Refer
      to the <em>JSON Grammar</em> section in [[!RFC4627]] for formal definitions.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>JSON object</tdef></dt><dd>
        An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding
        zero or more key-value pairs. A key is a <tref>string</tref>.
        A single colon comes after each key, separating the key from the value.
        A single comma separates a value from a following key. In contrast to JSON,
        in JSON-LD the keys in an object must be unique.</dd>
      <dt><tdef>array</tdef></dt>
      <dd>An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero
        or more values. Values are separated by commas.
        In JSON, an array is an <em>ordered</em> sequence of zero or more values.
        While JSON-LD uses the same array representation as JSON,
        the collection is <em>unordered</em> by default. While order is
        preserved in regular JSON arrays, it is not in regular JSON-LD arrays
        unless specifically defined (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#sets-and-lists"></a>).</dd>
      <dt><tdef>string</tdef></dt><dd>
        A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters,
        wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes (if necessary).</dd>
      <dt><tdef>number</tdef></dt>
      <dd>A number is similar to that used in most programming languages, except
        that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used and leading zeros
        are not allowed.</dd>
      <dt><tdef>true</tdef> and <tdef>false</tdef></dt><dd>
        Values that are used to express one of two possible boolean states.</dd>
      <dt><tdef>null</tdef></dt>
      <dd>The <tref>null</tref> value, which is typically used to clear or forget
        data. For example, a key-value pair in the
        <code>@context</code> where the value is <tref>null</tref> explicitly
        decouples a <tref>term</tref>'s association with an <tref>IRI</tref>.
        A key-value pair in the body of a JSON-LD document whose
        value is <tref>null</tref> has the same meaning as if the key-value pair
        was not defined. If <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>, or
        <code>@set</code> is set to <tref>null</tref> in expanded form, then
        the entire <tref>JSON object</tref> is ignored.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Data Model Overview</h2>

    <p>Generally speaking, the data model used for JSON-LD is a labeled,
      directed <tref>graph</tref>. The graph contains
      <tref title="node">nodes</tref>, which are connected by
      <tref title="edge">edges</tref>. A <tref>node</tref> is typically data
      such as a <tref>string</tref>, <tref>number</tref>,
      <tref title="typed value">typed values</tref> (like dates and times)
      or an <tref>IRI</tref>.
      There is also a special class of <tref>node</tref> called a
      <tref>blank node</tref>, which is typically used to express data that does
      not have a global identifier like an <tref>IRI</tref>.
      <tref title="blank node">Blank nodes</tref> are identified using a
      <tref>blank node identifier</tref>. This simple data model is incredibly
      flexible and powerful, capable of modeling almost any kind of
      data. For a deeper explanation of the data model, see
      section <a href="#data-model"></a>.
    </p>

    <p>Developers who are familiar with Linked Data technologies will
    recognize the data model as the RDF Data Model. To dive deeper into how
    JSON-LD and RDF are related, see
    section <a href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Syntax Tokens and Keywords</h2>

    <p>JSON-LD specifies a number of syntax tokens and <tdef title="keyword">keywords</tdef>
    that are a core part of the language:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to define the short-hand names that are used throughout a JSON-LD
        document. These short-hand names are called <tref title="term">terms</tref> and help
        developers to express specific identifiers in a compact manner. The
        <code>@context</code> keyword is described in detail in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#the-context"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@id</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to uniquely identify <em>things</em> that are being described in the document
        with <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> or
        <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>. This keyword
        is described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-identifiers"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@value</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify the data that is associated with a particular
        <tref>property</tref> in the graph. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#string-internationalization"></a> and
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@language</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify the language for a particular string value or the default
        language of a JSON-LD document. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#string-internationalization"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@type</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to set the data type of a <tref>node</tref> or
        <tref>typed value</tref>. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@container</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to set the default container type for a <tref>term</tref>.
        This keyword is described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#sets-and-lists"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@list</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to express an ordered set of data.
        This keyword is described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#sets-and-lists"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@set</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to express an unordered set of data and to ensure that values are always
         represented as arrays. This keyword is described in
         <a class="sectionRef" href="#sets-and-lists"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@reverse</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to express reverse properties. This keyword is described in
        <a class="sectionRef" href="#reverse-properties"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@index</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to specify that a container is used to index information and
        that processing should continue deeper into a JSON data structure.
        This keyword is described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#data-indexing"></a>.</dd>
      <dt><code>@base</code></dt>
      <dd>Used to set the base IRI against which <tref title="relative IRI">relative IRIs</tref>

<section class="normative">
  <h1>Conformance</h1>

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for JSON-LD documents.
    This criteria is relevant to authors and authoring tool implementers. As well
    as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples,
    and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this
    specification is normative.</p>

  <p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> complies with this specification if it follows
    the normative statements in appendix <a href="#json-ld-grammar"></a>. JSON documents
    can be interpreted as JSON-LD by following the normative statements in
    <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>. For convenience, normative
    statements for documents are often phrased as statements on the properties of the document.</p>

  <p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
    RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this specification have the
    meaning defined in [[!RFC2119]].</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

  <p>JSON [[RFC4627]] is a lightweight, language-independent data interchange format.
    It is easy to parse and easy to generate. However, it is difficult to integrate JSON
    from different sources as the data may contain keys that conflict with other
    data sources. Furthermore, JSON has no
    built-in support for hyperlinks, which are a fundamental building block on
    the Web. Let's start by looking at an example that we will be using for the
    rest of this section:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON document">
  <!--
  {
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
    "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>It's obvious to humans that the data is about a person whose
    <code>name</code> is "Manu Sporny"
    and that the <code>homepage</code> property contains the URL of that person's homepage.
    A machine doesn't have such an intuitive understanding and sometimes,
    even for humans, it is difficult to resolve ambiguities in such representations. This problem
    can be solved by using unambiguous identifiers to denote the different concepts instead of
    tokens such as "name", "homepage", etc.</p>

  <p>Linked Data, and the Web in general, uses <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    (Internationalized Resource Identifiers as described in [[!RFC3987]]) for unambiguous
    identification. The idea is to use <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    to assign unambiguous identifiers to data that may be of use to other developers.
    It is useful for <tref title="term">terms</tref>,
    like <code>name</code> and <code>homepage</code>, to expand to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    so that developers don't accidentally step on each other's terms. Furthermore, developers and
    machines are able to use this <tref>IRI</tref> (by using a web browser, for instance) to go to
    the term and get a definition of what the term means. This process is known as <tref>IRI</tref>
    dereferencing.</p>

  <p>Leveraging the popular <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org vocabulary</a>,
    the example above could be unambiguously expressed as follows:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON-LD document using full IRIs instead of terms">
  <!--
  {
    "****http://schema.org/name****": "Manu Sporny",
    "****http://schema.org/url****": ****{ "@id": ****"http://manu.sporny.org/" ****}****,  ####← The '@id' keyword means 'This value is an identifier that is an IRI'####
    "****http://schema.org/image****": ****{ "@id": ****"http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" ****}****
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, every property is unambiguously identified by an <tref>IRI</tref> and all values
    representing <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> are explicitly marked as such by the
    <code>@id</code> <tref>keyword</tref>. While this is a valid JSON-LD
    document that is very specific about its data, the document is also overly verbose and difficult
    to work with for human developers. To address this issue, JSON-LD introduces the notion
    of a <tref>context</tref> as described in the next section.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>The Context</h2>

    <p>When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes
    place in a shared environment, typically called
    "the context of the conversation". This shared context allows the
    individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend,
    to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in
    JSON-LD works in the same way. It allows two applications to use shortcut
    terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without
    losing accuracy.</p>

    <p>Simply speaking, a <tdef>context</tdef> is used to map <tref title="term">terms</tref> to
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>. <tref title="term">Terms</tref> are case sensitive
      and any valid <tref>string</tref> that is not a reserved JSON-LD <tref>keyword</tref>
      can be used as a <tref>term</tref>.</p>

    <p>For the sample document in the previous section, a <tref>context</tref> would
      look something like this:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Context for the sample document in the previous section">
    <!--
    {
      ****"@context":
      {
        "name": "http://schema.org/name",****  ####← This means that 'name' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/name'#### ****
        "image": {
          "@id": "http://schema.org/image",****  ####← This means that 'image' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/image'#### ****
          "@type": "@id"****  ####← This means that a string value associated with 'image' should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI#### ****
        },
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://schema.org/url",****  ####← This means that 'homepage' is shorthand for 'http://schema.org/url'#### ****
          "@type": "@id"****  ####← This means that a string value associated with 'homepage' should be interpreted as an identifier that is an IRI#### ****
        }
      }****
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>As the <tref>context</tref> above shows, the value of a <tdef>term definition</tdef> can
      either be a simple string, mapping the <tref>term</tref> to an <tref>IRI</tref>,
      or a <tref>JSON object</tref>.</p>

    <p>When a <tref>JSON object</tref> is associated with a term, it is called
      an <tdef>expanded term definition</tdef>. The example above specifies that
      the values of <code>image</code> and <code>homepage</code>, if they are
      strings, are to be interpreted as
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>. <tref title="expanded term definition">Expanded term definitions</tref>
      also allow terms to be used for <a href="#data-indexing">index maps</a>
      and to specify whether <tref title="array">array</tref> values are to be
      interpreted as <a href="#sets-and-lists">sets or lists</a>.
      <tref title="expanded term definition">Expanded term definitions</tref> may
      be defined using <tref title="absolute iri">absolute</tref> or
      <tref title="compact iri">compact IRIs</tref> as keys, which is
      mainly used to associate type or language information with an
      <tref title="absolute iri">absolute</tref> or <tref>compact IRI</tref>.</p>

    <p><tref title="context">Contexts</tref> can either be directly embedded
      into the document or be referenced. Assuming the context document in the previous
      example can be retrieved at <code>http://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld</code>,
      it can be referenced by adding a single line and allows a JSON-LD document to
      be expressed much more concisely as shown in the example below:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Referencing a JSON-LD context">
    <!--
    {
      ****"@context": "http://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",****
      "name": "Manu Sporny",
      "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
      "image": "http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png"
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The referenced context not only specifies how the terms map to
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> in the Schema.org vocabulary but also
      specifies that string values associated with
      the <code>homepage</code> and <code>image</code> property
      can be interpreted as an <tref>IRI</tref> (<code>"@type": "@id"</code>,
      see <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a> for more details). This information allows developers
      to re-use each other's data without having to agree to how their data will interoperate
      on a site-by-site basis. External JSON-LD context documents may contain extra
      information located outside of the <code>@context</code> key, such as
      documentation about the <tref title="term">terms</tref> declared in the
      document. Information contained outside of the <code>@context</code> value
      is ignored when the document is used as an external JSON-LD context document.</p>

    <p>JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD without having to be modified by
      referencing a <tref>context</tref> via an HTTP Link Header
      as described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#interpreting-json-as-json-ld"></a>. It is also
      possible to apply a custom context using the JSON-LD API [[JSON-LD-API]].</p>

    <p>In <tref title="JSON-LD document">JSON-LD documents</tref>,
      <tref title="context">contexts</tref> may also be specified inline.
      This has the advantage that documents can be processed even in the
      absence of a connection to the Web. Ultimately, this is a modeling decision
      and different use cases may require different handling.</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="In-line context definition">

  </section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>IRIs</h2>

  <p><tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> (Internationalized Resource Identifiers
    [[!RFC3987]]) are fundamental to Linked Data as that is how most
    <tref title="node">nodes</tref> and <tref title="property">properties</tref>
    are identified. In JSON-LD, IRIs may be represented as an
    <tref>absolute IRI</tref> or a <tref>relative IRI</tref>. An
    <tdef>absolute IRI</tdef> is defined in [[!RFC3987]] as containing a
    <em>scheme</em> along with <em>path</em> and optional <em>query</em> and
    <em>fragment</em> segments. A <tdef>relative IRI</tdef> is an IRI
    that is relative to some other <tref>absolute IRI</tref>.
    In JSON-LD all <tref title="relative IRI">relative IRIs</tref> are resolved
    relative to the <tdef>base IRI</tdef>.</p>

  <p>A <tref>string</tref> is interpreted as an <tref>IRI</tref> when it is the
    value of an <code>@id</code> member:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Values of @id are interpreted as IRI">
  <!--
  {
  ...
    "homepage": { "****@id****": "http://example.com/" }
  ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Values that are interpreted as <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>, can also be
    expressed as <tref title="relative IRI">relative IRIs</tref>. For example,
    assuming that the following document is located at
    <code>http://example.com/about/</code>, the <tref>relative IRI</tref>
    <code>../</code> would expand to <code>http://example.com/</code> (for more
    information on where  <tref title="relative IRI">relative IRIs</tref> can be
    used, please refer to section <a href="#json-ld-grammar"></a>).</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="IRIs can be relative">
  <!--
  {
  ...
    "homepage": { "****@id****": "../" }
  ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p><tref title="absolute iri">Absolute IRIs</tref> can be expressed directly
    in the key position like so:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="IRI as a key">
  <!--
  {
  ...
    "****http://schema.org/name****": "Manu Sporny",
  ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the key <code>http://schema.org/name</code>
    is interpreted as an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>.</p>

  <p>Term-to-IRI expansion occurs if the key matches a <tref>term</tref> defined
    within the <tref>active context</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Term expansion from context definition">
  <!--
  {
    "****@context****":
    {
      "****name****": "****http://schema.org/name****"
    },
    "****name****": "Manu Sporny",
    "status": "trollin'"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>JSON keys that do not expand to an <tref>IRI</tref>, such as <code>status</code>
    in the example above, are not Linked Data and thus ignored when processed.</p>

  <p>If type <tref>coercion</tref> rules are specified in the <code>@context</code> for
    a particular <tref>term</tref> or property IRI, an IRI is generated:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Type coercion">
  <!--
  {****
    "@context":
    {
      ...
      "homepage":
      {
        "@id": "http://schema.org/url",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
      ...
    }****
  ...
    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, since the value <code>http://manu.sporny.org/</code>
    is expressed as a JSON <tref>string</tref>, the type <tref>coercion</tref>
    rules will transform the value into an IRI when processing the data.
    See <a class="sectionRef" href="#type-coercion"></a> for more
    details about this feature.</p>

  <p>In summary, <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> can be expressed in a variety of
    different ways in JSON-LD:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><tref>JSON object</tref> keys that have a <tref>term</tref> mapping in
      the <tref>active context</tref> expand to an <tref>IRI</tref>
      (only applies outside of the <tref>context definition</tref>).</li>
    <li>An <tref>IRI</tref> is generated for the <tref>string</tref> value specified using
      <code>@id</code> or <code>@type</code>.</li>
    <li>An <tref>IRI</tref> is generated for the <tref>string</tref> value of any key for which there
      are <tref>coercion</tref> rules that contain an <code>@type</code> key that is
      set to a value of <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This section only covers the most basic features associated with IRIs
  in JSON-LD. More advanced features related to IRIs are covered in
  section <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a>.

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Node Identifiers</h2>

  <p>To be able to externally reference <tref title="node">nodes</tref>
    in a <tref title="graph">graph</tref>, it is important that
    <tref title="node">nodes</tref> have an identifier. <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    are a fundamental concept of Linked Data, for
    <tref title="node">nodes</tref> to be truly linked, dereferencing the
    identifier should result in a representation of that <tref>node</tref>.
    This may allow an application to retrieve further information about a
    <tref>node</tref>.</p>

  <p>In JSON-LD, a <tref>node</tref> is identified using the <code>@id</code>
    <tref>keyword</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Identifying a node">
  <!--
  {
    "@context":
    {
      ...
      "name": "http://schema.org/name"
    },
    ****"@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/"****,
    "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
    ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above contains a <tref>node object</tref> identified by the IRI
    <code>http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/</code>.</p>

  <p>This section only covers the most basic features associated with
  node identifiers in JSON-LD. More advanced features related to
  node identifiers are covered in section <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a>.
  </p>

</section>

<section class="informative">
<h2>Specifying the Type</h2>

<p>The type of a particular node can be specified using the <code>@type</code>
  <tref>keyword</tref>. In Linked Data, types are uniquely
  identified with an <tref>IRI</tref>.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifying the type for a node">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "****@type****": "****http://schema.org/Restaurant****",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>A node can be assigned more than one type by using an <tref>array</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifying multiple types for a node">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "****@type****": ****[ "http://schema.org/Restaurant", "http://schema.org/Brewery" ],****
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The value of an <code>@type</code> key may also be a <tref>term</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref>:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a term to specify the type">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ...
    ****"Restaurant": "http://schema.org/Restaurant", ****
    ****"Brewery": "http://schema.org/Brewery"****
  }
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  ****"@type": [ "Restaurant", "Brewery" ]****,
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p class="note">This section only covers the most basic features associated with
  types in JSON-LD. It is worth noting that the <code>@type</code>
  <tref>keyword</tref> is not only used to specify the type of a
  <tref>node</tref> but also to express <tref title="typed value">typed values</tref>
  (as described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>) and to
  <tref title="coercion">type coerce</tref> values (as described in
  <a class="sectionRef" href="#type-coercion"></a>). Specifically, <code>@type</code>
  cannot be used in a <tref>context</tref> to define a <tref title="node">node's</tref>
  type. For a detailed description of the differences, please refer to
  <a class="sectionRef" href="#typed-values"></a>.</p>

<section class="normative">
<h1>Advanced Concepts</h1>

<p>JSON-LD has a number of features that provide functionality above and beyond
  the core functionality described above. The following section describes this
  advanced functionality in more detail.</p>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Base IRI</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD allows <tref>IRI</tref>s to be specified in a relative form which is
    resolved against the document base according
    <cite><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1">section 5.1 Establishing a Base URI</a></cite>
    of [[RFC3986]]. The base IRI may be explicitly set with a <tref>context</tref>
    using the <code>@base</code> keyword.</p>

  <p>For example, if a JSON-LD document was retrieved from <code>http://example.com/document.jsonld</code>,
    relative IRIs would resolve against that IRI:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Use a relative IRI as node identifier">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "label": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"
      },
      ****"@id": ""****,
      "label": "Just a simple document"
    }
    -->
  </pre>

  <p>This document uses an empty <code>@id</code>, which resolves to the document base.
    However, if the document is moved to a different location, the <tref>IRI</tref> would change.
    To prevent this without having to use an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>, a <tref>context</tref>
    may define an <code>@base</code> mapping, to overwrite the base IRI for the document.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Setting the document base in a document">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ****"@base": "http://example.com/document.jsonld"****
    },
    "@id": "",
    "label": "Just a simple document"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Setting <code>@base</code> to <tref>null</tref> will prevent
    <tref title="relative IRI">relative IRIs</tref> to be expanded to
    <tref title="absolute IRI">absolute IRIs</tref>.</p>

  <p>Please note that the <code>@base</code> will be ignored if used in
    external contexts.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Default Vocabulary</h2>

  <p>At times, all properties and types may come from the same vocabulary. JSON-LD's
    <code>@vocab</code> keyword allows an author to set a common prefix to be used
    for all properties and types that do not match a <tref>term</tref> and are neither
    a <tref>compact IRI</tref> nor an <tref>absolute IRI</tref> (i.e., they do
    not contain a colon).</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Using a common vocabulary prefix">
  <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        ****"@vocab": "http://schema.org/"****
      }
      "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
      "@type": ****"Restaurant"****,
      ****"name"****: "Brew Eats"
      ...
    }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>If <code>@vocab</code> is used but certain keys in an
    <tref title="JSON object">object</tref> should not be expanded using
    the vocabulary <tref>IRI</tref>, a <tref>term</tref> can be explicitly set
    to <tref>null</tref> in the <tref>context</tref>. For instance, in the
    example below the <code>databaseId</code> member would not expand to an
    <tref>IRI</tref>.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Using the null keyword to ignore data">
  <!--
    {
      "@context":
      {
         "@vocab": "http://schema.org/",
         ****"databaseId": null****
      },
        "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
        "@type": "Restaurant",
        "name": "Brew Eats",
        ****"databaseId"****: "23987520"
    }
  -->
  </pre>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Compact IRIs</h2>

  <p>A <tdef>compact IRI</tdef> is a way of expressing an <tref>IRI</tref>
    using a <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).
    The <tdef>prefix</tdef> is a <tref>term</tref> taken from the
    <tref>active context</tref> and is a short string identifying a
    particular <tref>IRI</tref> in a JSON-LD document. For example, the
    prefix <code>foaf</code> may be used as a short hand for the
    Friend-of-a-Friend vocabulary, which is identified using the <tref>IRI</tref>
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>. A developer may append
    any of the FOAF vocabulary terms to the end of the prefix to specify a short-hand
    version of the <tref>absolute IRI</tref> for the vocabulary term. For example,
    <code>foaf:name</code> would be expanded to the IRI
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Prefix expansion">
  <!--
  {
    "****@context****":
    {
      "****foaf****": "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/****"
  ...
    },
    "@type": "****foaf:Person****"
    "****foaf:name****": "Dave Longley",
  ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, <code>foaf:name</code> expands to the <tref>IRI</tref>
    <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code> and <code>foaf:Person</code> expands
    to <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person</code>.</p>

  <p><tref title="prefix">Prefixes</tref> are expanded when the form of the value
    is a <tref>compact IRI</tref> represented as a <code>prefix:suffix</code>
    combination, the <em>prefix</em> matches a <tref>term</tref> defined within the
    <tref>active context</tref>, and the <em>suffix</em> does not begin with two
    slashes&nbsp;(<code>//</code>). The <tref>compact IRI</tref> is expanded by
    concatenating the <tref>IRI</tref> mapped to the <em>prefix</em> to the (possibly empty)
    <em>suffix</em>. If the <em>prefix</em> is not defined in the <tref>active context</tref>,
    or the suffix begins with two slashes (such as in <code>http://example.com</code>),
    the value is interpreted as <tref>absolute IRI</tref> instead. If the prefix is an
    underscore (<code>_</code>), the value is interpreted as <tref>blank node identifier</tref>
    instead.</p>


  <p>It's also possible to use compact IRIs within the context as shown in the
    following example:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"

<h2>Typed Values</h2>

<p>
  A value with an associated type, also known as a
  <tref>typed value</tref>, is indicated by associating a value with
  an <tref>IRI</tref> which indicates the value's type. Typed values may be
  expressed in JSON-LD in three ways:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>By utilizing the <code>@type</code> <tref>keyword</tref> when defining
    a <tref>term</tref> within an <code>@context</code> section.</li>
  <li>By utilizing a <tref>value object</tref>.</li>
  <li>By using a native JSON type such as <tref>number</tref>, <tref>true</tref>, or <tref>false</tref>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first example uses the <code>@type</code> keyword to associate a
type with a particular <tref>term</tref> in the <code>@context</code>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition with type coercion">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    "modified":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
    }
  },****
...
  "@id": "http://example.com/docs/1",
  "modified": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The <em>modified</em> key's value above is automatically type coerced to a
  <em>dateTime</em> value because of the information specified in the
  <code>@context</code>. A JSON-LD processor will interpret the example above
  as follows:</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Value Type</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.com/docs/1</td>
  <td>http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified</td>
  <td>2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00</td>
  <td>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The second example uses the expanded form of setting the type information
in the body of a JSON-LD document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded value with type">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "modified":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified"
    }
  },
...
  "modified":
  ****{
    "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
    "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
  }****
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Both examples above would generate the value
  <code>2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00</code> with the type
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</code>. Note that it is
  also possible to use a <tref>term</tref> or a <tref>compact IRI</tref> to
  express the value of a type.</p>

<p class="note">The <code>@type</code> <tref>keyword</tref> is also used to associate a type
  with a <tref>node</tref>. The concept of a <tref>node type</tref> and
  a <tref>value type</tref> are different.</p>

<p>A <tdef>node type</tdef> specifies the type of thing
  that is being described, like a person, place, event, or web page. A
  <tdef>value type</tdef> specifies the data type of a particular value, such
  as an integer, a floating point number, or a date.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Example demonstrating the context-sensitivity for @type">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/posts#TripToWestVirginia",
  ****"@type": "http://schema.org/BlogPosting"****,  ####← This is a node type####
  "modified":
  {
    "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
    ****"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"****  ####← This is a value type####
  }
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The first use of <code>@type</code> associates a <tref>node type</tref>
  (<code>http://schema.org/BlogPosting</code>) with the <tref>node</tref>,
  which is expressed using the <code>@id</code> <tref>keyword</tref>.
  The second use of <code>@type</code> associates a <tref>value type</tref>
  (<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</code>) with the
  value expressed using the <code>@value</code> <tref>keyword</tref>. As a
  general rule, when <code>@value</code> and <code>@type</code> are used in
  the same <tref>JSON object</tref>, the <code>@type</code>
  <tref>keyword</tref> is expressing a <tref>value type</tref>.
  Otherwise, the <code>@type</code> <tref>keyword</tref> is expressing a
  <tref>node type</tref>. The example above expresses the following data:</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Value Type</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/posts#TripToWestVirginia</td>
  <td>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type</td>
  <td>http://schema.org/BlogPosting</td>
  <td style="text-align:center;">-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/posts#TripToWestVirginia</td>
  <td>http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified</td>
  <td>2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00</td>
  <td>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>Type Coercion</h2>

<p>JSON-LD supports the coercion of values to particular data types.
Type <tdef>coercion</tdef> allows someone deploying JSON-LD to coerce the incoming or
outgoing values to the proper data type based on a mapping of data type <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> to
<tref title="term">terms</tref>. Using type coercion, value representation is preserved without requiring
the data type to be specified with each piece of data.</p>

<p>Type coercion is specified within an <tref>expanded term definition</tref>
  using the <code>@type</code> key. The value of this key expands to an <tref>IRI</tref>.
  Alternatively, the <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code> may be used
  as value to indicate that within the body of a JSON-LD document, a <tref>string</tref> value of a
  <tref>term</tref> coerced to <code>@id</code> or <code>@vocab</code> is to be interpreted as an
  <tref>IRI</tref>. The difference between <code>@id</code> and <code>@vocab</code> is how values are expanded
  to <tref title="absolute IRI">absolute IRIs</tref>. <code>@vocab</code> first tries to expand the value
  by interpreting it as <tref>term</tref>. If no matching <tref>term</tref> is found in the
  <tref>active context</tref>, it tries to expand it as <tref>compact IRI</tref> or <tref>absolute IRI</tref>
  if there's a colon in the value; otherwise, it will expand the value using the
  <tref title="active context">active context's</tref> vocabulary mapping, if present, or by interpreting it
  as <tref>relative IRI</tref>. Values coerced to <code>@id</code> in contrast are expanded as
  <tref>compact IRI</tref> or <tref>absolute IRI</tref> if a colon is present; otherwise, they are interpreted
  as <tref>relative IRI</tref>.</p>

<p><tref title="term">Terms</tref> or <tref title="compact iri">compact IRIs</tref> used as the value of a
  <code>@type</code> key may be defined within the same context. This means that one may specify a
  <tref>term</tref> like <code>xsd</code> and then use <code>xsd:integer</code> within the same
  context definition.</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates how a JSON-LD author can coerce values to
<tref title="typed value">typed values</tref> and <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition with types">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age":
    ****{
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    }****,
    "homepage":

  },

  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": ****"41"****,
  "homepage":
  ****[
    "http://personal.example.org/",
    "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  ]****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The example shown above would generate the following data.</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Value Type</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.com/people#john</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</td>
  <td>John Smith</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.com/people#john</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age</td>
  <td>41</td>
  <td>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2">http://example.com/people#john</td>
  <td rowspan="2">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</td>
  <td>http://personal.example.org/</td>
  <td><tref>IRI</tref></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://work.example.com/jsmith/</td>
  <td><tref>IRI</tref></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Terms may also be defined using <tref title="absolute iri">absolute IRIs</tref>
  or <tref title="compact iri">compact IRIs</tref>. This allows coercion rules
  to be applied to keys which are not represented as a simple <tref>term</tref>.
  For example:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Term definitions using compact and absolute IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "****foaf:age****":
    {
      ****"@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age"****,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****":
    {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  "foaf:name": "John Smith",
  "****foaf:age****": "41",
  "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****":
  [
    "http://personal.example.org/",
    "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  ]
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In this case the <code>@id</code> definition in the term definition is optional.
  If it does exist, the <tref>compact IRI</tref> or <tref>IRI</tref> representing
  the term will always be expanded to <tref>IRI</tref> defined by the <code>@id</code>
  key&mdash;regardless of whether a prefix is defined or not.</p>

<p>Type coercion is always performed using the unexpanded value of the key. In the
  example above, that means that type coercion is done looking for <code>foaf:age</code>
  in the <tref>active context</tref> and not for the corresponding, expanded
  <tref>IRI</tref> <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age</code>.</p>

<p class="note">Keys in the context are treated as <tref title="term">terms</tref> for the purpose of
  expansion and value coercion. At times, this may result in multiple representations for the same expanded IRI.
  For example, one could specify that <code>dog</code> and <code>cat</code> both expanded to <code>http://example.com/vocab#animal</code>.
  Doing this could be useful for establishing different type coercion or language specification rules. It also allows a <tref>compact IRI</tref> (or even an
  absolute <tref>IRI</tref>) to be defined as something else entirely. For example, one could specify that
  the <tref>term</tref> <code>http://example.org/zoo</code> should expand to
  <code>http://example.org/river</code>, but this usage is discouraged because it would lead to a
  great deal of confusion among developers attempting to understand the JSON-LD document.</p>

  <h2>Embedding</h2>

  <p><tdef>Embedding</tdef> is a JSON-LD feature that allows an author to
    use <tref title="node object">node objects</tref> as
    <tref>property</tref> values. This is a commonly used mechanism for
    creating a parent-child relationship between two <tref title="node">nodes</tref>.</p>

  <p>The example shows two nodes related by a property from the first node:</p>

  ...

  <p>
    A <tref>node object</tref>, like the one used above, may be used in

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Advanced Context Usage</h2>

  <p>Section <a href="#the-context"></a> introduced the basics of what makes
  JSON-LD work. This section expands on the basic principles of the
  <tref>context</tref> and demonstrates how more advanced use cases can
  be achieved using JSON-LD. </p>

  <p>In general, contexts may be used at any time a
    <tref>JSON object</tref> is defined. The only time that one cannot
    express a context is inside a context definition itself. For example, a
    <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> may use more than one context at different
    points in a document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Using multiple contexts">
  <!--
  [
    {
      ****"@context": "http://example.org/contexts/person.jsonld",****
      "name": "Manu Sporny",
      "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
      "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
    },
    {
      ****"@context": "http://example.org/contexts/place.jsonld",****
      "name": "The Empire State Building",
      "description": "The Empire State Building is a 102-story landmark in New York City.",
      "geo": {
        "latitude": "40.75",
        "longitude": "73.98"
      }
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Duplicate context <tref title="term">terms</tref> are overridden using a
    most-recently-defined-wins mechanism.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Scoped contexts within node objects">
  <!--
  {
    ****"@context":
    {
      "name": "http://example.com/person#name",
      "details": "http://example.com/person#details"
    }****,
    "****name****": "Markus Lanthaler",
    ...
    "details":
    {
      ****"@context":
      {
        "name": "http://example.com/organization#name"
      }****,
      "****name****": "Graz University of Technology"
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the <code>name</code> <tref>term</tref> is overridden
    in the more deeply nested <code>details</code> structure. Note that this is
    rarely a good authoring practice and is typically used when working with
    legacy applications that depend on a specific structure of the
    <tref>JSON object</tref>. If a <tref>term</tref> is redefined within a
    context, all previous rules associated with the previous definition are
    removed. If a <tref>term</tref> is redefined to <code>null</code>,
    the <tref>term</tref> is effectively removed from the list of
    <tref title="term">terms</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref>.</p>

  <p>Multiple contexts may be combined using an <tref>array</tref>, which is processed
    in order. The set of contexts defined within a specific <tref>JSON object</tref> are
    referred to as <tdef title="local context">local contexts</tdef>. The
    <tdef>active context</tdef> refers to the accumulation of
    <tref title="local context">local contexts</tref> that are in scope at a
    specific point within the document. Setting a <tref>local context</tref>
    to <code>null</code> effectively resets the <tref>active context</tref>
    to an empty context. The following example specifies an external context
    and then layers an embedded context on top of the external context:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Combining external and local contexts">
  <!--
  {
    ****"@context": [
      "http://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",

    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
    ****"pic": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"****
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p class="note">When possible, the <tref>context</tref> definition should be put
    at the top of a JSON-LD document. This makes the document easier to read and
    might make streaming parsers more efficient. Documents that do not have the
    <tref>context</tref> at the top are still conformant JSON-LD.</p>

  <p class="note">To avoid forward-compatibility issues, <tref title="term">terms</tref>
    starting with an&nbsp;<code>@</code> character are to be avoided as they
    might be used as <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> in future versions
    of JSON-LD. Terms starting with an&nbsp;<code>@</code> character that are not
    <tref title="keyword">JSON-LD 1.0 keywords</tref> are treated as any other term, i.e.,
    they are ignored unless mapped to an <tref>IRI</tref>. Furthermore, the use of
    empty <tref title="term">terms</tref> (<code>""</code>) is not allowed as
    not all programming languages are able to handle empty JSON keys.</p>

  <h2>Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD</h2>

  <p>Ordinary JSON documents can be interpreted as JSON-LD by referencing a JSON-LD
    <tref>context</tref> document in an HTTP Link Header. Doing so allows JSON to
    be unambiguously machine-readable without requiring developers to drastically
    change their documents and provides an upgrade path for existing infrastructure
    without breaking existing clients that rely on the <code>application/json</code>
    media type or a media type with a <code>+json</code> suffix as defined in
    [[RFC6839]].</p>

  <p>In order to use an external context with an ordinary JSON document, an author
    MUST specify an <tref>IRI</tref> to a valid <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> in
    an HTTP Link Header [[!RFC5988]] using the <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code>
    link relation. The referenced document MUST have a top-level <tref>JSON object</tref>.
    The <code>@context</code> subtree within that object is added to the top-level
    <tref>JSON object</tref> of the referencing document. If an <tref>array</tref>
    is at the top-level of the referencing document and its items are
    <tref title="JSON object">JSON objects</tref>, the <code>@context</code>
    subtree is added to all <tref>array</tref> items. All extra information located outside
    of the <code>@context</code> subtree in the referenced document MUST be
    discarded. Effectively this means that the <tref>active context</tref> is
    initialized with the referenced external <tref>context</tref>. A response MUST NOT
    contain more than one HTTP Link Header [[!RFC5988]] using the
    <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> link relation.</p>

  <p>The following example demonstrates the use of an external context with an
    ordinary JSON document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Referencing a JSON-LD context from a JSON document via an HTTP Link Header">
  <!--
  GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1

  </pre>

  <p>Please note that <tref title="JSON-LD document">JSON-LD documents</tref>
    served with the <code>application/ld+json</code>
    media type MUST have all context information, including references to external

    <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> HTTP Link Header MUST be
    ignored for such documents.</p>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>String Internationalization</h2>

  <p>At times, it is important to annotate a <tref>string</tref>
    with its language. In JSON-LD this is possible in a variety of ways.
    First, it is possible to define a default language for a JSON-LD document
    by setting the <code>@language</code> key in the <tref>context</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Setting the default language of a JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  {
    ****"@context":
    {
      ...
      "@language": "ja"
    }****,
    "name": ****"花澄"****,
    "occupation": ****"科学者"****
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above would associate the <code>ja</code> language
    code with the two <tref title="string">strings</tref> <em>花澄</em> and <em>科学者</em>.
    Languages codes are defined in [[!BCP47]]. The default language applies to all
    <tref>string</tref> values that are not <a href="#type-coercion">type coerced</a>.</p>

  <p>To clear the default language for a subtree, <code>@language</code> can
    be set to <code>null</code> in a <tref>local context</tref> as follows:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Clearing default language">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ...
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": "花澄",
    "details": {
  ****    "@context": {
        "@language": null
      }****,
      "occupation": "Ninja"
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Second, it is possible to associate a language with a specific <tref>term</tref>
    using an <tref>expanded term definition</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Expanded term definition with language">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ...
      "ex": "http://example.com/vocab/",
      "@language": "ja",
      "name": { "@id": "ex:name", ****"@language": null**** },
      "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation" },
      "occupation_en": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "en"**** },
      "occupation_cs": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "cs"**** }
    },
    ****"name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
    "occupation": "忍者",
    "occupation_en": "Ninja",
    "occupation_cs": "Nindža",****
    ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above would associate <em>忍者</em> with the specified default
    language code <code>ja</code>, <em>Ninja</em> with the language code
    <code>en</code>, and <em>Nindža</em> with the language code <code>cs</code>.
    The value of <code>name</code>, <em>Yagyū Muneyoshi</em> wouldn't be
    associated with any language code since <code>@language</code> was reset to
    <tref>null</tref> in the <tref>expanded term definition</tref>.</p>

  <p class="note">Language associations are only applied to plain
    <tref title="string">strings</tref>. <tref title="typed value">Typed values</tref>
    or values that are subject to <a href="#type-coercion">type coercion</a>
    are not language tagged.</p>

  <p>Just as in the example above, systems often need to express the value of a
    property in multiple languages. Typically, such systems also try to ensure that
    developers have a programmatically easy way to navigate the data structures for
    the language-specific data. In this case, <tref title="language map">language maps</tref>
    may be utilized.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Language map expressing a property in three languages">
  <!--
  {
    "@context":
    {
      ...
      "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@container": "@language"**** }
    },
    "name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
    "occupation":
    ****{
      "ja": "忍者",
      "en": "Ninja",
      "cs": "Nindža"
    }****
    ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above expresses exactly the same information as the previous
    example but consolidates all values in a single property. To access the
    value in a specific language in a programming language supporting dot-notation
    accessors for object properties, a developer may use the
    <code>property.language</code> pattern. For example, to access the occupation
    in English, a developer would use the following code snippet:
    <code>obj.occupation.en</code>.</p>

  <p>Third, it is possible to override the default language by using a
    <tref>value object</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Overriding default language using an expanded value">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      ...
      "@language": "ja"
    },
    "name": "花澄",
    "occupation": ****{
      "@value": "Scientist",
      "@language": "en"
    }****
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>This makes it possible to specify a plain string by omitting the
    <code>@language</code> tag or setting it to <code>null</code> when expressing
    it using a <tref>value object</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Removing language information using an expanded value">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {

    }****,
    "occupation": {
      "@value": "Ninja",

  <h2>IRI Expansion within a Context</h2>
  <p>In general, normal IRI expansion rules apply
    anywhere an IRI is expected (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#iris"></a>). Within
    a <tref>context</tref> definition, this can mean that terms defined
    within the context may also be used within that context as long as
    there are no circular dependencies. For example, it is common to use
    the <code>xsd</code> namespace when defining <tref>typed value</tref>s:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="IRI expansion within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"****,
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": ****"xsd:integer"****
    },
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In this example, the <code>xsd</code> <tref>term</tref> is defined
  and used as a <tref>prefix</tref> for the <code>@type</code> coercion
  of the <code>age</code> property.</p>

<p><tref title="term">Terms</tref> may also be used when defining the IRI of another
<tref>term</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a term to define the IRI of another term within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": ****"foaf:name"****,
    "age":
    {
      "@id": ****"foaf:age"****,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": ****"foaf:homepage"****,
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p><tref title="compact iri">Compact IRIs</tref>
  and <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> may be used on the left-hand side of a
  <tref>term</tref> definition.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a compact IRI as a term">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "****foaf:age****":
    {
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****foaf:homepage****":
    ****{
      "@type": "@id"
    }****
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the <tref>compact IRI</tref> form is used in two different
ways.
In the first approach, <code>foaf:age</code> declares both the
<tref>IRI</tref> for the <tref>term</tref> (using short-form) as well as the
<code>@type</code> associated with the <tref>term</tref>. In the second
approach, only the <code>@type</code> associated with the <tref>term</tref> is
specified. The full <tref>IRI</tref> for
<code>foaf:homepage</code> is determined by looking up the <code>foaf</code>
<tref>prefix</tref> in the
<tref>context</tref>.
</p>

<p>
<tref title="absolute iri">Absolute IRIs</tref> may also be used in the key position in a <tref>context</tref>:
</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Associating context definitions with absolute IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "foaf:age":
    {
      "@id": "foaf:age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****":
    {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In order for the <tref>absolute IRI</tref> to match above, the <tref>absolute IRI</tref>
  needs to be used in the <tref>JSON-LD document</tref>. Also note that <code>foaf:homepage</code>
  will not use the <code>{ "@type": "@id" }</code> declaration because
  <code>foaf:homepage</code> is not the same as <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</code>.
  That is, <tref title="term">terms</tref> are looked up in a <tref>context</tref> using
  direct string comparison before the <tref>prefix</tref> lookup mechanism is applied.</p>

<p class="note">While it is possible to define a <tref>compact IRI</tref>, or
  an <tref>absolute IRI</tref> to expand to some other unrelated <tref>IRI</tref>
  (for example, <code>foaf:name</code> expanding to
  <code>http://example.org/unrelated#species</code>), such usage is strongly
  discouraged.</p>

<p>The only exception for using terms in the <tref>context</tref> is that
  circular definitions are not allowed. That is,
  a definition of <em>term1</em> cannot depend on the
  definition of <em>term2</em> if <em>term2</em> also depends on
  <em>term1</em>. For example, the following <tref>context</tref> definition
  is illegal:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Illegal circular definition of terms within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"term1": "term2:foo",
    "term2": "term1:bar"****
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<h2>Sets and Lists</h2>

<p>A JSON-LD author can express multiple values in a compact way by using
  <tref title="array">arrays</tref>. Since graphs do not describe ordering for links
  between nodes, arrays in JSON-LD do not provide an ordering of the
  contained elements by default. This is exactly the opposite from regular JSON
  arrays, which are ordered by default. For example, consider the following
  simple document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Multiple values with no inherent order">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "nick": ****[ "joe", "bob", "JB" ]****,
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The example shown above would result in the following data being generated,
  each relating the node to an individual value, with no inherent order:</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Value</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/people#joebob</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</td>
  <td>joe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/people#joebob</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</td>
  <td>bob</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/people#joebob</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</td>
  <td>JB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Multiple values may also be expressed using the expanded form:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using an expanded form to set multiple values">
<!--
{
  "@id": "http://example.org/articles/8",
  "dc:title": ****
  [
    {
      "@value": "Das Kapital",
      "@language": "de"
    },
    {
      "@value": "Capital",
      "@language": "en"
    }
  ]****
}-->
</pre>

<p>The example shown above would generate the following data, again with
  no inherent order:</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Language</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/articles/8</td>
  <td>http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</td>
  <td>Das Kapital</td>
  <td>de</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/articles/8</td>
  <td>http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</td>
  <td>Capital</td>
  <td>en</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>As the notion of ordered collections is rather important in data
  modeling, it is useful to have specific language support. In JSON-LD,
  a list may be represented using the <code>@list</code> <tref>keyword</tref> as follows:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="An ordered collection of values in JSON-LD">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "foaf:nick":
  ****{
    "@list": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]
  }****,
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>This describes the use of this <tref>array</tref> as being ordered,
  and order is maintained when processing a document. If every use of a given multi-valued
  property is a list, this may be abbreviated by setting <code>@container</code>
  to <code>@list</code> in the <tref>context</tref>:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifying that a collection is ordered in the context">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    ...
    "nick":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick",
      "@container": "@list"
    }
  }****,
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "nick": ****[ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]****,
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p class="note">List of lists in the form of <tref title="list object">list objects</tref>
  are not allowed in this version of JSON-LD. This decision was made due to the
  extreme amount of added complexity when processing lists of lists.</p>

<p>While <code>@list</code> is used to describe <em>ordered lists</em>,
  the <code>@set</code> keyword is used to describe <em>unordered sets</em>.
  The use of <code>@set</code> in the body of a JSON-LD document
  is optimized away when processing the document, as it is just syntactic
  sugar. However, <code>@set</code> is helpful when used within the context
  of a document.
  Values of terms associated with an <code>@set</code> or <code>@list</code> container
  are always represented in the form of an <tref>array</tref>,
  even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
  a non-array form in compact form (see
  <a class="sectionRef" href="#compacted-document-form"></a>). This makes post-processing of
  JSON-LD documents easier as the data is always in array form, even if the
  array only contains a single value.</p>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Reverse Properties</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD serializes directed <tref title="graph">graphs</tref>. That means that
    every <tref>property</tref> points from a <tref>node</tref> to another <tref>node</tref>
    or <tref title="JSON-LD value">value</tref>. However, in some cases, it is desirable
    to serialize in the reverse direction. Consider for example the case where a person
    and its children should be described in a document. If the used vocabulary does not
    provide a <em>children</em> <tref>property</tref> but just a <em>parent</em>
    <tref>property</tref>, every <tref>node</tref> representing a child would have to
    be expressed with a <tref>property</tref> pointing to the parent as in the following
    example.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="A document with children linking to their parent">
  <!--
  [
    {
      ****"@id": "#homer"****,
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Homer"
    },
    {
      "@id": "#bart",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Bart",
      ****"http://example.com/vocab#parent": { "@id": "#homer" }****
    },
    {
      "@id": "#lisa",
      "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Lisa",
      ****"http://example.com/vocab#parent": { "@id": "#homer" }****
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Expressing such data is much simpler by using JSON-LD's <code>@reverse</code>
    <tref>keyword</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="A person and its children using a reverse property">
  <!--
  {
    "@id": "#homer",
    "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Homer",
    ****"@reverse"****: {
      ****"http://example.com/vocab#parent"****: [
        {
          "@id": "#bart",
          "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Bart"
        },
        {
          "@id": "#lisa",
          "http://example.com/vocab#name": "Lisa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The <code>@reverse</code> <tref>keyword</tref> can also be used in
    <tref title="expanded term definition">expanded term definitions</tref>
    to create reverse properties as shown in the following example:</p>

  <p>When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is an

  <h2>Identifying Blank Nodes</h2>

  <p>At times, it becomes necessary to be able to express information without
    being able to uniquely identify the <tref>node</tref> with an <tref>IRI</tref>.
    This type of node is called a <tref>blank node</tref>. JSON-LD does not require
    all nodes to be identified using <code>@id</code>. However, some graph topologies
    may require identifiers to be serializable. Graphs containing loops, e.g., cannot
    be serialized using embedding alone, <code>@id</code> must be used to connect the nodes.
    In these situations, one can use <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>,
    which look like <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> using an underscore (<code>_</code>)
    as scheme. This allows one to reference the node locally within the document, but
    makes it impossible to reference the node from an external document. The
    <tref>blank node identifier</tref> is scoped  to the document in which it is used.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Specifying a local blank node identifier">
  <!--
  {
     ...
     "@id": "****_:n1****",
     "name": "Secret Agent 1",
     "knows":
       {
         "name": "Secret Agent 2",
         "knows": { "@id": "****_:n1****" }
       }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above contains information about two secret agents that cannot be identified
    with an <tref>IRI</tref>. While expressing that <em>agent&nbsp;1</em> knows <em>agent&nbsp;2</em>
    is possible without using <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>,
    it is necessary to assign <em>agent&nbsp;1</em> an identifier so that it can be referenced
    from <em>agent&nbsp;2</em>.</p>
  <p>It is worth nothing that blank node identifiers may be relabeled during processing.
    If a developer finds that they refer to the <tref>blank node</tref> more than once,
    they should consider naming the node using a dereferenceable <tref>IRI</tref> so that
    it can also be referenced from other documents.</p>

  <h2>Aliasing Keywords</h2>

  <p>Each of the JSON-LD <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>,
    except for <code>@context</code>, may be aliased to application-specific
    keywords. This feature allows legacy JSON content to be utilized
    by JSON-LD by re-using JSON keys that already exist in legacy documents.
    This feature also allows developers to design domain-specific implementations
    using only the JSON-LD <tref>context</tref>.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Aliasing keywords">
  <!--
  {
    "@context":
    {
       ****"url": "@id"****,
       ****"a": "@type"****,
       "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
    },
    "****url****": "http://example.com/about#gregg",
    "****a****": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
    "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code>
    <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> have been given the aliases
    <strong>url</strong> and <strong>a</strong>, respectively.</p>

  <p>Since keywords cannot be redefined, they can also not be aliased to
    other keywords.</p>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Data Indexing</h2>

  <p>Databases are typically used to make access to
    data more efficient. Developers often extend this sort of functionality into
    their application data to deliver similar performance gains. Often this
    data does not have any meaning from a Linked Data standpoint, but is
    still useful for an application.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD introduces the notion of <tref title="index map">index maps</tref>
    that can be used to structure data into a form that is
    more efficient to access. The data indexing feature allows an author to
    structure data using a simple key-value map where the keys do not map
    to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>. This enables direct access to data
    instead of having to scan an array in search of a specific item.
    In JSON-LD such data can be specified by associating the
    <code>@index</code> <tref>keyword</tref> with a
    <code>@container</code> declaration in the context:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Indexing data in JSON-LD">
  <!--
  {
    "@context":
    {
       "schema": "http://schema.org/",
       "name": "schema:name",
       "body": "schema:articleBody",
       "words": "schema:wordCount",
       "post": {
         "@id": "schema:blogPost",
         ****"@container": "@index"****
       }
    },
    "@id": "http://example.com/",
    "@type": "schema:Blog",
    "name": "World Financial News",
    ****"post": {
       "en": {
         "@id": "http://example.com/posts/1/en",
         "body": "World commodities were up today with heavy trading of crude oil...",
         "words": 1539
       },
       "de": {
         "@id": "http://example.com/posts/1/de",
         "body": "Die Werte an Warenbörsen stiegen im Sog eines starken Handels von Rohöl...",
         "words": 1204
       }****
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the <strong>post</strong> <tref>term</tref> has
    been marked as an <tref>index map</tref>. The <strong>en</strong> and
    <strong>de</strong> keys will be ignored  semantically, but preserved
    syntactically, by the JSON-LD Processor.  This allows a developer to
    access the German version of the <strong>post</strong> using the
    following code snippet: <code>obj.post.de</code>.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of the data above is expressed in
    the table below. Note how the index keys do not appear in the Linked Data
    below, but would continue to exist if the document were compacted or
    expanded (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#compacted-document-form"></a> and
    <a class="sectionRef" href="#expanded-document-form"></a>) using a JSON-LD processor:</p>

  <h3>Expanded Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]]
    defines a method for <em>expanding</em> a JSON-LD document.
    Expansion is the process of taking a JSON-LD document and applying a
    <code>@context</code> such that all IRIs, types, and values
    are expanded so that the <code>@context</code> is no longer necessary.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  {
     "@context":
     {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "homepage": {
          "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
          "@type": "@id"
        }
     },
     "name": "Manu Sporny",
     "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Running the JSON-LD Expansion algorithm against the JSON-LD input document
    provided above would result in the following output:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Expanded form for the previous example">
  <!--

</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h3>Compacted Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]] defines
    a method for <em>compacting</em> a JSON-LD document. Compaction is the process
    of applying a developer-supplied context to shorten <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    to <tref title="term">terms</tref> or <tref title="compact IRI">compact IRIs</tref>
    and JSON-LD values expressed in expanded form to simple values such as
    <tref title="string">strings</tref> or <tref title="number">numbers</tref>.
    Often this makes it simpler to work with document as the data is expressed in
    application-specific terms. Compacted documents are also typically easier to read
    for humans.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample expanded JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  [
    {
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [ "Manu Sporny" ],
      "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
        {
         "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD context:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample context">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",

        "@type": "@id"
      }
    }
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Running the JSON-LD Compaction algorithm given the context supplied above
    against the JSON-LD input document provided above would result in the following
    output:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Compact form of the sample document once sample context has been applied">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {

    form is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted</code>.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h3>Flattened Document Form</h3>

  <p>The JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]] defines
    a method for <em>flattening</em> a JSON-LD document. Flattening collects all
    properties of a <tref>node</tref> in a single <tref>JSON object</tref> and labels
    all <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref> with
    <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>.
    This ensures a shape of the data and consequently may drastically simplify the code
    required to process JSON-LD in certain applications.</p>

  <p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Sample JSON-LD document">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",

      }
    ]
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>Running the JSON-LD Flattening algorithm against the JSON-LD input document in
    the example above and using the same context would result in the following
    output:</p>

  <h1>Data Model</h1>

  <p>JSON-LD is a serialization format for Linked Data based on JSON.
    It is therefore important to distinguish between the syntax, which is
    defined by JSON in [[RFC4627]], and the <tdef>data model</tdef> which is
    an extension of the RDF data model [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. The precise
    details of how JSON-LD relates to the RDF data model are given in
    <a class="sectionRef" href="#relationship-to-rdf"></a>.</p>

  <p>To ease understanding for developers unfamiliar with the RDF model, the

    <li>The <tref>default graph</tref> does not have a name and MAY be empty.</li>
    <li>Each <tref>named graph</tref> is a pair consisting of an <tref>IRI</tref> or

  <h1>JSON-LD Grammar</h1>

  <p>This appendix restates the syntactic conventions described in the
    previous sections more formally.</p>

  <p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> MUST be a valid JSON document as described
    in [[!RFC4627]].</p>

  <p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> MUST be a single <tref>node object</tref>
    or an <tref>array</tref> whose elements are each
    <tref title="node object">node objects</tref> at the top level.</p>

  <p>In contrast to JSON, in JSON-LD the keys in <tref title="JSON object">objects</tref>
    MUST be unique.</p>

  <p class="note">JSON-LD allows <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> to be aliased
    (see <a class="sectionRef" href="#aliasing-keywords"></a> for details). Whenever a <tref>keyword</tref> is
    discussed in this grammar, the statements also apply to an alias for
    that <tref>keyword</tref>. For example, if the <tref>active context</tref>
    defines the <tref>term</tref> <code>id</code> as an alias for <code>@id</code>,
    that alias may be legitimately used as a substitution for <code>@id</code>.
    Note that <tref>keyword</tref> aliases are not expanded during context
    processing.</p>

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Terms</h2>

    <p>A <tdef>term</tdef> is a short-hand <tref>string</tref> that expands
      to an <tref>IRI</tref> or a <tref>blank node identifier</tref>.</p>

    <p>A <tref>term</tref> MUST NOT equal any of the JSON-LD
      <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>.</p>

    <p>To avoid forward-compatibility issues, a <tref>term</tref> SHOULD NOT start
      with an <code>@</code> character as future versions of JSON-LD may introduce
      additional <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>. Furthermore, the term MUST NOT
      be an empty <tref>string</tref> (<code>""</code>) as not all programming languages
      are able to handle empty JSON keys.</p>

    <h2>Node Objects</h2>

    <p>A <tdef>node object</tdef> represents zero or more properties of a
      <tref>node</tref> in the <tref>graph</tref> serialized by the
      <tref>JSON-LD document</tref>. A <tref>JSON object</tref> is a
      <tref>node object</tref> if it exists outside of a JSON-LD
      <tref>context</tref> and:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it does not contain the <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>,
        or <code>@set</code> keywords, and</li>
      <li>it is not the top-most <tref>JSON object</tref> in the JSON-LD document
        consisting of no other members than <code>@graph</code> and
        <code>@context</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <tref title="property">properties</tref> of a <tref>node</tref> in
      a <tref>graph</tref> may be spread among different
      <tref title="node object">node objects</tref> within a document. When
      that happens, the keys of the different
      <tref title="node object">node objects</tref> need to be merged to create the
      properties of the resulting <tref>node</tref>.</p>

    <p>A <tref>node object</tref> MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref>. All keys
      which are not <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>,
      <tref title="compact iri">compact IRIs</tref>, <tref title="term">terms</tref>
      valid in the <tref>active context</tref>, or one of the following
      <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> MUST be ignored when processed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>@context</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@id</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@graph</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@type</code>,</li>
      <li><code>@reverse</code>, or</li>
      <li><code>@index</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@context</code>
      key, its value MUST be <tref>null</tref>, an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>,
      a <tref>relative IRI</tref>, a <tref>context definition</tref>, or
      an <tref>array</tref> composed of any of these.</p>

    <p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@id</code> key,
      its value MUST be an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>, a <tref>relative IRI</tref>,
      or a <tref>compact IRI</tref> (including
      <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>).
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#node-identifiers"></a>,
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#compact-iris"></a>, and
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#identifying-blank-nodes"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@id</code> values.</p>

    <p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@graph</code>
      key, its value MUST be
      a <tref>node object</tref> or
      an <tref>array</tref> of zero or more <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>.
      If the <tref>node object</tref> contains an <code>@id</code> keyword,
      its value is used as the label of a named graph.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#named-graphs"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@graph</code> values. As a special case, if a <tref>JSON object</tref>
      contains no keys other than <code>@graph</code> and <code>@context</code>, and the
      <tref>JSON object</tref> is the root of the JSON-LD document, the
      <tref>JSON object</tref> is not treated as a <tref>node object</tref>; this
      is used as a way of defining <tref title="node object">node
      definitions</tref> that may not form a connected graph. This allows a
      <tref>context</tref> to be defined which is shared by all of the constituent
      <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>.</p>

    <p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@type</code>
      key, its value MUST be either an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>, a
      <tref>relative IRI</tref>, a <tref>compact IRI</tref>
      (including <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>),
      a <tref>term</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref> expanding into an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>, or
      an <tref>array</tref> of any of these.
      See <a class="sectionRef" href="#specifying-the-type"></a> for further discussion on
      <code>@type</code> values.</p>

    <p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@reverse</code> key,
      its value MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref> containing members representing reverse
      properties. Each value of such a reverse property MUST be an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>,
      a <tref>relative IRI</tref>, a <tref>compact IRI</tref>, a <tref>blank node identifier</tref>,
      a <tref>node object</tref> or an <tref>array</tref> containing a combination of these.</p>

    <p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@index</code> key,
      its value MUST be a <tref>string</tref>. See
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#data-indexing"></a> for further discussion
      on <code>@index</code> values.</p>

    <p>Keys in a <tref>node object</tref> that are not
      <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> MAY expand to an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>
      using the <tref>active context</tref>. The values associated with keys that expand
      to an <tref>absolute IRI</tref> MUST be one of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><tref>string</tref>,</li>
      <li><tref>number</tref>,</li>
      <li><tref>true</tref>,</li>

    <h2>Value Objects</h2>

    <p>A <tdef>value object</tdef> is used to explicitly associate a type or a

      string</tref>.</p>

    <p>A <tref>value object</tref> MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref> containing the

    <h2>Lists and Sets</h2>

    <p>A <tref>list</tref> represents an <em>ordered</em> set of values. A set
      represents an <em>unordered</em> set of values. Unless otherwise specified,
      <tref title="array">arrays</tref> are unordered in JSON-LD. As such, the
      <code>@set</code> keyword, when used in the body of a JSON-LD document,
      represents just syntactic sugar which is optimized away when processing the document.
      However, it is very helpful when used within the context of a document. Values
      of terms associated with an <code>@set</code> or <code>@list</code> container
      will always be represented in the form of an <tref>array</tref> when a document
      is processed&mdash;even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
      a non-array form in <a href="#compacted-document-form">compact document form</a>.
      This simplifies post-processing of the data as the data is always in a
      deterministic form.</p>

    <p>A <tdef>list object</tdef> MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref> that contains no
      keys that expand to an <tref>absolute IRI</tref> or <tref>keyword</tref> other

    or an <tref>expanded term definition</tref>.</p>

  <p>An <tref>expanded term definition</tref> is used to describe the mapping

  <h2>Relationship to RDF</h2>

  <p>JSON-LD is a
    <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax">concrete RDF syntax</tref>
    as described in [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]. Hence, a JSON-LD document is both an
    RDF document <em>and</em> a JSON document and correspondingly represents an
    instance of an RDF data model. However, JSON-LD also extends the RDF data
    model to optionally allow JSON-LD to serialize
    <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-generalized-rdf-dataset">Generalized RDF Datasets</tref>.
    The JSON-LD extensions to the RDF data model are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In JSON-LD <tref title="property">properties</tref> can be
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> or <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
      whereas in RDF properties (predicates) have to be <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>. This
      means that JSON-LD serializes
      <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-generalized-rdf-dataset">generalized RDF Datasets</tref>.</li>
    <li>In JSON-LD <tref title="list">lists</tref> are part of the data model
      whereas in RDF they are part of a vocabulary, namely [[RDF11-SCHEMA]].</li>
    <li>RDF values are either typed <em>literals</em>
      (<tref title="typed value">typed values</tref>) or
      <tref title="language-tagged string">language-tagged strings</tref> whereas
      JSON-LD also supports JSON's native data types, i.e., <tref title="number">number</tref>,
      <tref title="string">strings</tref>, and the boolean values <tref>true</tref>
      and <tref>false</tref>. The JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]]
      defines the <a href="../json-ld-api/#data-round-tripping">conversion rules</a>
      between JSON's native data types and RDF's counterparts to allow round-tripping.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Summarized, these differences mean that JSON-LD is capable of serializing any RDF
    graph or dataset and most, but not all, JSON-LD documents can be directly
    interpreted as RDF as described in RDF 1.1 Concepts [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</p>

  <p>For authors and developers working with <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
    as <tref title="property">properties</tref> when deserializing to RDF,
    three potential approaches are suggested:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the author is not yet ready to commit to a stable IRI, the
      property should be mapped to an IRI that is documented as unstable.</li>
    <li>If the developer wishes to use <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
      as <tref title="property">properties</tref> and also wishes to interpret the
      data as a
      <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-generalized-rdf-dataset">generalized RDF Dataset</tref>,
      there is an option, <i>produce generalized RDF</i>, in the
      Deserialize JSON-LD to RDF algorithm [[JSON-LD-API]] to do so. Note that a
      <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-generalized-rdf-dataset">generalized RDF Dataset</tref>
      is an extension of RDF; it does not conform to the RDF standard.</li>
    <li>If the author or developer wishes to use <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
      as <tref title="property">properties</tref> and wishes to interpret the data
      as a standard (non-generalized)
      <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF Dataset</tref>,
      it is possible to losslessly interpret JSON-LD as RDF by transforming
      <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref> used as
      <tref title="property">properties</tref> to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>,
      by minting new "Skolem IRIs" as per
      <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-skolemization">Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs</a></cite>
      of [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The normative algorithms for interpreting JSON-LD as RDF and serializing
    RDF as JSON-LD are specified in the JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API
    specification [[JSON-LD-API]].</p>

  <p>Even though JSON-LD serializes
    <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-generalized-rdf-dataset">generalized RDF Datasets</tref>, it can
    also be used as a <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-source">RDF graph source</tref>.
    In that case, a consumer MUST only use the default graph and ignore all named graphs.
    This allows servers to expose data in languages such as Turtle and JSON-LD
    using content negotiation.</p>

  <p class="note">Publishers supporting both dataset and graph syntaxes have to ensure that
    the primary data is stored in the default graph to enable consumers that do not support
    datasets to process the information.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h3>Serializing/Deserializing RDF</h3>

    <p>The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD and deserializing JSON-LD to RDF
      depends on executing the algorithms defined in
      <cite><a href="../json-ld-api/#rdf-serialization-deserialization-algorithms">RDF Serialization-Deserialization Algorithms</a></cite>
      in the JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]].
      It is beyond the scope of this document to detail these algorithms any further,
      but a summary of the necessary operations is provided to illustrate the process.</p>

    <p>The procedure to deserialize a JSON-LD document to RDF involves the
      following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Expand the JSON-LD document, removing any context; this ensures
        that properties, types, and values are given their full representation
        as <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> and expanded values. Expansion
        is discussed further in <a class="sectionRef" href="#expanded-document-form"></a>.</li>
      <li>Flatten the document, which turns the document into an array of
        <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>. Flattening is discussed
        further in <a class="sectionRef" href="#flattened-document-form"></a>.</li>
      <li>Turn each <tref>node object</tref> into a series of
        <tref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-triple">RDF triples</tref>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example, consider the following JSON-LD document in compact form:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Sample JSON-LD document">
    <!--
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
        "knows": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows"
      },
      "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
      "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
      "knows": [
        {
          "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
          "name": "Manu Sporny"
        },
        {
          "name": "Dave Longley"
        }
      ]
    }
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Running the JSON-LD Expansion and Flattening algorithms against the
      JSON-LD input document in the example above would result in the
      following output:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Flattened and expanded form for the previous example">
    <!--
    [
      {
        "@id": "_:b0",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Dave Longley"
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Manu Sporny"
      },
      {
        "@id": "http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": "Markus Lanthaler",
        "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows": [
          { "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu" },
          { "@id": "_:b0" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>Deserializing this to RDF now is a straightforward process of turning
      each <tref>node object</tref> into one or more RDF triples. This can be
      expressed in Turtle as follows:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Turtle representation of expanded/flattened document">
    <!--
    _:b0 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Dave Longley" .

    <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Manu Sporny" .

    <http://me.markus-lanthaler.com/> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Markus Lanthaler" ;
        <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <http://manu.sporny.org/about#manu>, _:b0 .
    -->
    </pre>

    <p>The process of serializing RDF as JSON-LD can be thought of as the
      inverse of this last step, creating an expanded JSON-LD document closely
      matching the triples from RDF, using a single <tref>node object</tref>
      for all triples having a common subject, and a single <tref>property</tref>
      for those triples also having a common predicate.</p>

  <h2>Relationship to Other Linked Data Formats</h2>

  <p>The JSON-LD examples below demonstrate how JSON-LD can be used to
    express semantic data marked up in other linked data formats such as Turtle,
    RDFa, Microformats, and Microdata. These sections are merely provided as
    evidence that JSON-LD is very flexible in what it can express across different

      <h4>Conversion of native data types</h4>

      <p>In JSON-LD numbers and boolean values are native data types. While Turtle
        has a shorthand syntax to express such values, RDF's abstract syntax requires
        that numbers and boolean values are represented as typed literals. Thus,
        to allow full round-tripping, the JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]]
        defines conversion rules between JSON-LD's native data types and RDF's
        counterparts. <tref title="number">Numbers</tref> without fractions are
        converted to <code>xsd:integer</code>-typed literals, numbers with fractions
        to <code>xsd:double</code>-typed literals and the two boolean values
        <tref>true</tref> and <tref>false</tref> to a <code>xsd:boolean</code>-typed
        literal. All typed literals are in canonical lexical form.</p>

          <p>A non-empty list of space-separated URIs identifying specific
            constraints or conventions that apply to a JSON-LD document according to [[RFC6906]].
            A profile does not change the semantics of the resource representation
            when processed without profile knowledge, so that clients both with
            and without knowledge of a profiled resource can safely use the same
            representation. The <code>profile</code> parameter MAY be used by
            clients to express their preferences in the content negotiation process.
            If the profile parameter is given, a server SHOULD return a document that
            honors the profiles in the list which are recognized by the server.
            It is RECOMMENDED that profile URIs are dereferenceable and provide
            useful documentation at that URI. For more information and background
            please refer to [[RFC6906]].</p>
          <p>This specification defines three values for the <code>profile</code> parameter.
            To request or specify <a href="#expanded-document-form">expanded JSON-LD document form</a>,
            the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded</code> SHOULD be used.
            To request or specify <a href="#compacted-document-form">compacted JSON-LD document form</a>,
            the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted</code> SHOULD be used.
            To request or specify <a href="#flattened-document-form">flattened JSON-LD document form</a>,
            the URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened</code> SHOULD be used.
            Please note that, according [[HTTP11]], the value of the <code>profile</code>
            parameter has to be enclosed in quotes (<code>"</code>) because it contains
            special characters and, if multiple profiles are combined, whitespace.</p>
          <p>When processing the "profile" media type parameter, it is important to
            note that its value contains one or more URIs and not IRIs. In some cases
            it might therefore be necessary to convert between IRIs and URIs as specified in
            <cite><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1">section 3 Relationship between IRIs and URIs</a></cite>
            of [[RFC3987]].</p>

    <dd>See [[!RFC4627]]
      <p>Since JSON-LD is intended to be a pure data exchange format for
        directed graphs, the serialization SHOULD NOT be passed through a
        code execution mechanism such as JavaScript's <code>eval()</code>
        function to be parsed. An (invalid) document may contain code that,
        when executed, could lead to unexpected side effects compromising
        the security of a system.</p>
      <p>When processing JSON-LD documents, links to remote contexts are
        typically followed automatically, resulting in the transfer of files
        without the explicit request of the user for each one. If remote
        contexts are served by third parties, it may allow them to gather
        usage patterns or similar information leading to privacy concerns.
        Specific implementations, such as the API defined in the
        JSON-LD Processing Algorithms and API specification [[JSON-LD-API]],
        may provide fine-grained mechanisms to control this behavior.</p>
      <p>JSON-LD contexts that are loaded from the Web over non-secure connections,
        such as HTTP, run the risk of being altered by an attacker such that
        they may modify the JSON-LD <tref>active context</tref> in a way that
        could compromise security. It is advised that any application that
        depends on a remote context for mission critical purposes vet and
        cache the remote context before allowing the system to use it.</p>
      <p>Given that JSON-LD allows the substitution of long IRIs with short terms,
        JSON-LD documents may expand considerably when processed and, in the worst case,
        the resulting data might consume all of the recipient's resources. Applications
        should treat any data with due skepticism.</p>

  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

  <p>The authors would like to extend a deep appreciation and the most sincere
    thanks to Mark Birbeck, who contributed foundational concepts
    to JSON-LD via his work on RDFj. JSON-LD uses a number of core concepts
    introduced in RDFj, such as the context as a mechanism to provide an
    environment for interpreting JSON data. Mark had also been very involved in
    the work on RDFa as well. RDFj built upon that work. JSON-LD exists
    because of the work and ideas he started nearly a decade ago in 2004.</p>

  <p>A large amount of thanks goes out to the JSON-LD Community Group
    participants who worked through many of the technical issues on the mailing
    list and the weekly telecons - of special mention are François Daoust,
    Stéphane Corlosquet, Lin Clark, and Zdenko 'Denny' Vrandečić.</p>

  <p>The work of David I. Lehn and Mike Johnson are appreciated for
    reviewing, and performing several early implementations
    of the specification. Thanks also to Ian Davis for this work on RDF/JSON.</p>
