JSON has proven to be a highly useful object serialization and messaging format.
In an attempt to harmonize the representation of <tref>Linked Data</tref>
in JSON, this specification outlines a common JSON representation format for
expressing directed graphs; mixing both Linked Data and non-Linked Data in
a single document.
</p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
<p>This document has been under development for over 20 months in the
JSON for Linking Data Community Group. The document has recently been
transferred to the RDF Working Group for review, improvement, and publication
along the Recommendation track. The specification has undergone significant
development, review, and changes during the course of the last 20 months.
</p>
<p>There are several independent
<a href="http://json-ld.org/#impl">interoperable implementations</a> of
this specification. There is
a <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/tree/master/test-suite">fairly complete test suite</a>
and a <a href="http://json-ld.org/playground/">live JSON-LD editor</a>
that is capable of demonstrating the features described in
this document. While development on implementations, the test suite
and the live editor will continue, they are believed to be mature enough
to be integrated into a non-production system at this point in time with
the expectation that they could be used in a production system within the
next year.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p><tdef>Linked Data</tdef> is a technique for creating a network
    of inter-connected data across different documents and Web sites. In general,
    Linked Data has four properties: 1)&nbsp;it uses <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    to name things; 2)&nbsp;it uses HTTP <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>
    for those names; 3)&nbsp;the name <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>, when dereferenced,
    provide more information about the name; and 4)&nbsp;the data expresses links
    to data on other Web sites. These properties allow data published on the Web
    to work much like Web pages do today. One can start at one piece of Linked Data,
    and follow the links to other pieces of data that are hosted on different
    sites across the Web.</p>

  <p>JSON-LD is designed as a lightweight syntax to express <tref>Linked Data</tref> in
    JSON [[!RFC4627]]. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in
    Web-based programming environments. It is also useful when building interoperable
    Web services and when storing Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. Since
    JSON-LD is 100% compatible with JSON the large number of JSON parsers and libraries
    available today can be reused. Additionally to all the features JSON provides,
    JSON-LD introduces:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a universal identifier mechanism for <tref title="JSON object">JSON objects</tref> via the
      use of <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>,</li>
    <li>a way to disambiguate the keys used between multiple JSON documents
      by mapping them to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> via a <tref>context</tref>,</li>
    <li>a mechanism in which a value in a <tref>JSON object</tref> may refer
      to a <tref>JSON object</tref> on a different site on the Web,</li>
    <li>the ability to express the language associated with a <tref>string</tref></li>
    <li>a way to associate datatypes with values such as dates, times, weights,
      and distances,</li>
    <li>and a facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social
      network, in a single document.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Developers that require any of the facilities listed above or need to serialize
    an RDF graph or dataset [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] in a JSON-based syntax will find
    JSON-LD of interest. The syntax is designed to not disturb already deployed
    systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth upgrade path from JSON to
    JSON-LD.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for a serialization of Linked
      Data in JSON. The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers that want to encode Linked Data in a variety of
      programing languages that can use JSON.</li>
      <li>Software developers that want to understand the design decisions and
      language syntax for JSON-LD.</li>
      <li>Software developers that want to implement processors and APIs for
      JSON-LD.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This specification does not describe the programming interfaces for the
      JSON-LD Syntax. The specification that describes the programming interfaces
      for JSON-LD documents is the JSON-LD Application Programming Interface
      [[JSON-LD-API]].</p>

    <p>To understand the basics in this specification you must first be familiar with
      JSON, which is detailed in [[!RFC4627]].</p>
  </section>
</section>

<section class="informative">
<h1>Design Goals and Rationale</h1>

<p>A number of design goals were established before the creation of this
  markup language:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Simplicity</dt>
 <dd>No extra
 processors or software libraries should be necessary to use JSON-LD in its most
 basic form. The language will provide developers with a very easy
 learning curve. Developers only need to know JSON and two
 <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> (<code>@context</code>
 and <code>@id</code>) to use the basic functionality in JSON-LD.</dd>
 <dt>Compatibility</dt>
 <dd>The JSON-LD markup must be 100% compatible with JSON. This ensures that
 all of the standard JSON libraries work seamlessly with JSON-LD documents.</dd>
 <dt>Expressiveness</dt>
 <dd>The syntax must be able to express directed graphs, which have been proven
 to be able to express almost every real world data model.</dd>
 <dt>Terseness</dt>
 <dd>The JSON-LD syntax must be very terse and human readable, requiring as
 little effort as possible from the developer.</dd>
 <!--<dt>Pragmatism</dt>
 <dd>Mixing the expression of pure Linked Data with data that is not
 linked was an approach that was driven by pragmatism. JSON-LD attempts to be
 more practical than theoretical in its approach to Linked Data.</dd>-->
 <dt>Zero Edits, most of the time</dt>
 <dd>JSON-LD must provide a
 <a href="#referencing-contexts-from-json-documents">mechanism</a>
 that allows developers to reference <tref title="context">contexts</tref> in
 responses using plain old JSON. This allows organizations that have
 already deployed large JSON-based infrastructure to use JSON-LD's features
 in a way that is not disruptive to their day-to-day operations and is
 transparent to their current customers. At times, mapping JSON to
 a graph representation can become difficult. In these instances, rather than
 having JSON-LD support an esoteric use case, we chose not to support the
 use case and support a simplified syntax instead. So, while Zero Edits is
 a design goal, it is not always possible without adding great complexity to
 the language.
 </dd>
 <dt>One-pass Processing</dt>
 <dd>JSON-LD supports one-pass processing, which results in a very small memory
 footprint when processing documents. For example, to expand a JSON-LD document
 from a compacted form, only one pass is required over the data.</dd>
 <!--<dt>Linked Data-centric</dt>
 <dd>The focus on Linked Data is placed at a much higher priority than the
 focus on the Semantic Web. One outcome of this ordering of
 priorities is an aggressively reduced focus on the Semantic Web stack.
 While this may be off-putting to proponents of the Semantic Web, the audience
 for this specification are Web developers that want a gentler introduction
 and a simpler technology stack for using Linked Data in their Web applications.
 Semantic Web concepts, such as conversion to and from RDF, are fully supported
 by JSON-LD, but the implementation of these features are not elaborated upon
 in this specification. See <a href="#relationship-to-other-linked-data-formats"></a>
 for more information about how JSON-LD integrates into the more traditional
 Semantic Web stack.

<h1>Terminology</h1>

<section>
  <h2>General Terminology</h2>

  <p>This document uses terms defined in JSON [[!RFC4627]] described in the
    following list. Refer to the JSON grammar section in JSON for formal
    definitions.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><tdef>JSON object</tdef></dt><dd>
      An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets
      surrounding zero or more key-value pairs. A key is a
      <tref>string</tref>. A single colon comes after each key, separating the
      key from the value. A single comma separates a value from a following
      key.
    </dd>
    <dt><tdef>array</tdef></dt>
    <dd>
      An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero
      or more values (or elements). Elements are separated by commas.
      In JSON, an array is an <em>ordered</em> sequence of zero or more values.
      While JSON-LD uses the same array representation as JSON,
      the collection is <em>unordered</em> by default. While order is
      preserved in regular JSON arrays, it is not in regular JSON-LD arrays
      unless specific markup is provided (see <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>).</dd>
    <dt><tdef>string</tdef></dt><dd>
      A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters,
      wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes (if necessary). A
      character is represented as a single character string.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>number</tdef></dt>
    <dd>
      A number is similar to that used in most programming languages, except
      that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used and that leading
      zeros are not allowed.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>true</tdef> and <tdef>false</tdef></dt><dd>
      Values that are used to express one of two possible boolean states.</dd>
    <dt><tdef>null</tdef></dt>
    <dd>The <tref>null</tref> value. A key-value pair in the
      <code>@context</code> where the value, or the <code>@id</code> of the
      value, is <tref>null</tref> explicitly decouples a term's association
      with an IRI. A key-value pair in the body of a JSON-LD document whose
      value is <tref>null</tref> has the same meaning as if the key-value pair
      was not defined. If <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>, or
      <code>@set</code> is set to <tref>null</tref> in expanded form, then
      the entire <tref>JSON object</tref> is ignored.</dd>
  </dl>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Syntax Tokens and Keywords</h2>

<p>JSON-LD specifies a number of syntax tokens and <tdef title="keyword">keywords</tdef>
that are a core part of the language:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>@context</code></dt>
<dd>Used to define the short-hand names that are used throughout a JSON-LD
  document. These short-hand names are called <tref title="term">terms</tref> and help
  developers to express specific identifiers in a compact manner. The
  <code>@context</code> keyword is described in detail in the section titled
  <a href="#the-context"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@id</code></dt>
<dd>Used to uniquely identify <em>things</em> that are being described in the document.
  This keyword is described in <a href="#node-identifiers"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@value</code></dt>
<dd>Used to specify the data that is associated with a particular
  <tref>property</tref> in the graph. This keyword is described in
  <a href="#string-internationalization"></a> and
  <a href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@language</code></dt>
<dd>Used to specify the native language for a particular value or the default
  language of a JSON-LD document. This keyword is described in the section titled
  <a href="#string-internationalization"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@type</code></dt>
<dd>Used to set the data type of a <tref>node</tref> or
  <tref>typed value</tref>. This keyword is described in the section titled
  <a href="#typed-values"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@container</code></dt>
<dd>Used to set the container of a particular value.
  This keyword is described in the section titled <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@list</code></dt>
<dd>Used to express an ordered set of data.
  This keyword is described in the section titled <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@set</code></dt>
<dd>Used to express an unordered set of data and to ensure that values are always
  represented as arrays. This keyword is described in the section titled
  <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@vocab</code></dt>
<dd>Used to expand properties and values in <code>@type</code> with a common prefix
  <tref>IRI</tref>. This keyword is described in section <a href="#iris"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>@graph</code></dt><dd>Used to explicitly label a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>.
  This keyword is described in <a href="#named-graphs"></a>.</dd>
<dt><code>:</code></dt>
<dd>The separator for JSON keys and values that use
  <tref title="compact_iri">compact IRIs</tref>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, all keys, <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>, and values in JSON-LD are
case-sensitive.</p>
</section>

</section>

<section class="normative">
<h1>Conformance</h1>

<p>The JSON-LD Syntax specification describes the conformance criteria for JSON-LD documents (relevant to authors and authoring tool implementors).</p>

<p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> complies with this specification if it follows the normative statements for documents defined in sections <a href="#referencing-contexts-from-json-documents"></a> and <a href="#json-ld-grammar"></a>. For convenience, normative statements for documents are often phrased as statements on the properties of the document.</p>

<p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this Recommendation have the meaning defined in [[!RFC2119]].</p>

</section>

<section class="normative">
<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

<section>
<h2>The Context</h2>

<p>In JSON-LD, a <tdef>context</tdef> is used to map <tref title="term">terms</tref>, i.e., properties with associated
  values in an JSON document, to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>.</p>
<p>The Web uses <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> for unambiguous identification. The
  idea is that these <tref title="term">terms</tref> mean something that may be of use to other developers and that it is useful to
  give them an unambiguous identifier. That is, it is useful for <tref title="term">terms</tref> to expand to IRIs so that
  developers don't accidentally step on each other's <tdef>vocabulary</tdef> terms and other resources. Furthermore, developers, and
  machines, are able to use this <tref>IRI</tref> (by plugging it directly into a web browser, for instance) to go to
  the term and get a definition of what the term means. This mechanism is analogous to the way we can use
  <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> today to see the definition of words in the English language.
  Developers and machines need the same sort of definition of terms. <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> provide a way to
  ensure that these terms are unambiguous. For example, the term <code>name</code> may
  map directly to the IRI <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>. This allows JSON-LD documents to be constructed
  using the common JSON practice of simple key-value pairs while ensuring that the data is useful outside of the
  page, API or database in which it resides.</p>

<p>Note that, to avoid forward-compatibility issues, terms starting with an <code>@</code> character are to be avoided as they might be used as keywords in future versions of JSON-LD. Furthermore, the use of empty <tref title="term">terms</tref> (<code>""</code>)
  is discouraged as not all programming languages are able to handle empty
  property names.
</p>

<p>In a JSON-LD document, the mapping between <tref title="term">terms</tref> and
  <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> is typically collected in a <tref>context definition</tref>
  that would look something like this:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Context definition">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "depiction":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/depiction",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
  }
}
-->
</pre>

<p>
Let's assume that a developer starts with the following JSON document:
</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Sample JSON document">
<!--
{
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The developer can add a single line to the JSON document above
to reference the context and transform it into a JSON-LD document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Referencing a JSON-LD context">
<!--
{
  ****"@context": "http://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",****
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The additions above transform the previous JSON document into a JSON document
with added semantics because the <code>@context</code> specifies how the
<strong>name</strong>, <strong>homepage</strong>, and <strong>depiction</strong>
terms map to <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>.
Mapping those keys to IRIs gives the data global context. If two
developers use the same IRI to describe a property, they are more than likely
expressing the same concept. This allows both developers to re-use each others'
data without having to agree to how their data will interoperate on a
site-by-site basis. Contexts may also contain type, language or additional information
for certain <tref title="term">terms</tref>.</p>

<p>External JSON-LD context documents may contain extra information
located outside of the <code>@context</code> key, such as documentation about the
<tref title="term">terms</tref> declared in the document. Information contained
outside of the <code>@context</code> value is simply discarded when the document
is used as an external JSON-LD context document
(see <a href="#referencing-contexts-from-json-documents"></a>).</p>

<p>Contexts may also be specified in-line. This ensures that
  <tref title="JSON-LD document">JSON-LD documents</tref> can be understood
  even in the absence of a connection to the Web.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="In-line context definition">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "depiction":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/depiction",
      "@type": "@id"
    },

<p>Contexts may be used at any time a <tref>node object</tref> is defined.
  In particular, a <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> may define more than one context,
  as in the following example:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Multiple separate contexts">
<!--
[
  {
    ****"@context": "http://example.org/contexts/person.jsonld",****
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
    "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
  },
  {
    ****"@context": "http://example.org/contexts/place.jsonld",****
    "name": "The Empire State Building",
    "description": "The Empire State Building is a 102-story landmark in New York City.",
    "geo": {
      "latitude": "40.75",
      "longitude": "73.98"
    }
  }
]
-->
</pre>

<p>This is useful when an author would like to use an existing context
  and add application-specific terms to the existing context. Duplicate context
  <tref title="term">terms</tref> are overridden using a last-defined-overrides
  mechanism.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Scoped contexts within node objects">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    "name": "http://example.com/person#name",
    "details": "http://example.com/person#details"
  },****
  "****name****": "Markus Lanthaler",
  ...
  "details":
  {
    ****"@context": {
      "name": "http://example.com/organization#name"
    },****
    "****name****": "Graz University of Technology"
  }
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the <code>name</code> prefix is overridden in the
  more deeply nested <code>details</code> structure. Note that this is
  rarely a good authoring practice and is typically used when there exist
  legacy applications that depend on the specific structure of the
  <tref>JSON object</tref>. If a <tref>term</tref> is re-defined within a
  context, all previous rules associated with the previous definition are
  removed. If that <tref>term</tref> is re-defined to <code>null</code>,
  the <tref>term</tref> is effectively removed from the list of
  <tref title="term">terms</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref>.</p>

<p>A <tref>node object</tref> may specify multiple contexts, using an
  <tref>array</tref>, processed in order. The set of contexts defined within a specific <tref>node object</tref> are
  referred to as <tdef title="local context">local contexts</tdef>. Setting the context to <code>null</code>
  effectively resets the <tref>active context</tref> to an empty context. The
  <tdef>active context</tdef> refers to the accumulation of <tref title="local context">local contexts</tref>
  that are in scope at a specific point within the document. The following example
  specifies an external context and then layers a local context on top of the external
  context:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Combining external and local contexts">
<!--
{
  ****"@context": [
    "http://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",
    {
      "pic": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/depiction"
    }
  ],****
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  ****"pic": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"****
}
-->
</pre>

<p class="note">To ensure the best possible performance, it is a best practice to
  put the <tref>context</tref> definition at the top of the JSON-LD document. If it isn't listed
  first, processors have to save each key-value pair until the <tref>context</tref> is processed.
  This creates a memory and complexity burden for certain types of
  low-memory footprint JSON-LD processors.</p>

<section>
  <h2>From JSON to JSON-LD</h2>

  <p>If a set of <tref title="term">terms</tref> such as, <strong>name</strong>,
    <strong>homepage</strong>, and <strong>depiction</strong>,
    are defined in a <tref>context</tref>, and that context is used to resolve the
    names in <tref title="JSON object">JSON objects</tref>, machines are able to automatically expand the terms to
    something unambiguous like this:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Expanded terms">
  <!--
  {
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name****": "Manu Sporny",
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****": "http://manu.sporny.org"
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/depiction****": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
  }
   -->
  </pre>

  <p>Doing this allows JSON to be unambiguously machine-readable without
    requiring developers to drastically change their workflow. A <tref>JSON object</tref>
     used to define property values of a <tref>node</tref> is called a <tref>node object</tref>.</p>

  <p class="note">The example above does not use the <code>@id</code> <tref>keyword</tref>
    to identify the node being described above. This type of node is called a
    <tref>blank node</tref>. It is advised that all <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>
    in JSON-LD are identified by <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> via the <code>@id</code>
    keyword unless the data is not intended to be linked to from other data sets.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>IRIs</h2>

<p><tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) are fundamental to <tref>Linked Data</tref> as
  that is how most <tref title="node">nodes</tref> and <tref title="property">properties</tref>
  are identified. <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> can be expressed in a variety of different ways in JSON-LD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Except within a <tref>context</tref> definition, <tref title="term">terms</tref> in the
    key position in a <tref>JSON object</tref> that have a mapping in the <tref>active context</tref> expand to an <tref>IRI</tref>. If there's a <code>@vocab</code>
    mapping in the active context also <tref title="term">terms</tref> without an explicit mapping
    in the active context are expanded to an <tref>IRI</tref>.</li>
  <li>An <tref>IRI</tref> is generated for the <tref>string</tref> value specified using
    <code>@id</code> or <code>@type</code>.</li>
  <li>An <tref>IRI</tref> is generated for the <tref>string</tref> value of any key for which there
    are <tref>coercion</tref> rules in effect that identify the value as an <code>@id</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>IRIs may be represented as an <tref>absolute IRI</tref> or a <tref>relative IRI</tref>.</p>

<p>An <tdef>absolute IRI</tdef> is defined in [[!RFC3987]] containing a <em>scheme</em> along with
  <em>path</em> and optional <em>query</em> and <em>fragment</em> segments. A <tdef>relative IRI</tdef> is an IRI
  that is relative to some other <tref>absolute IRI</tref>. In JSON-LD all <tref title="relative IRI">relative IRIs</tref> are resolved relative to the
  <tdef>base IRI</tdef> associated with the document (typically, the directory that contains the document or the document itself).</p>

<p>IRIs can be expressed directly in the key position like so:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="IRI as a key">
<!--
{
...
  "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name****": "Manu Sporny",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the key <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code> is interpreted
  as an <tref>IRI</tref> because it contains a colon
  (<code>:</code>) and the 'http' <tref>prefix</tref> does not exist in
  the context.</p>

<p>Term expansion occurs for IRIs if the value matches a <tref>term</tref> defined within the
<tref>active context</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Term expansion from context definition">
<!--
{
  "****@context****":
  {
    "****name****": "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name****"
...
  },
  "****name****": "Manu Sporny",
  "status": "trollin'",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p><tref title="term">Terms</tref> are case sensitive.</p>

<p>JSON keys that do not expand to an absolute IRI are ignored, or removed
in some cases, by the [[JSON-LD-API]]. However, JSON keys that do not include
a mapping in the <tref>context</tref> are still considered valid expressions
in JSON-LD documents - the keys just don't expand to unambiguous identifiers.</p>

<p><tref title="prefix">Prefixes</tref> are expanded when the form of the value is a
  <tref>compact IRI</tref> represented as a <code>prefix:suffix</code>
  combination, and the prefix matches a <tref>term</tref> defined within the
  <tref>active context</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Prefix expansion">
<!--
{
  "****@context****":
  {
    "****foaf****": "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/****"
...
  },
  "****foaf:name****": "Manu Sporny",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p><code>foaf:name</code> above will automatically expand out to the IRI
<code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>. See <a href="#compact-iris"></a> for more details.</p>

<p>It is often common that all types and properties come from the same vocabulary. JSON-LD's
  <code>@vocab</code> keyword allows to set a common prefix to be used for all properties and types
  that neither match a <tref>term</tref> nor a <tref>compact IRI</tref> or an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>
  (i.e., do not contain a colon).</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a common vocabulary prefix">
<!--
{
  ****"@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/1.0/"
  },****
  "@type": ****"Person"****,
  ****"name"****: "Manu Sporny",
}
-->
</pre>

<p>An <tref>IRI</tref> is generated when a <tref>JSON object</tref> is used in the
  value position that contains an <code>@id</code> keyword:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded IRI definition">
<!--
{
...
  "homepage": { "****@id****": "http://manu.sporny.org" }
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Specifying a <tref>JSON object</tref> with an
  <code>@id</code> key is used to identify that <tref>node</tref> using an
  <tref>IRI</tref>. When the object has only the <code>@id</code>, it
  is called a <tref>node object</tref>. This facility may also be used to link to another
  <tref>node object</tref> using a mechanism called
  <tref>embedding</tref>, which is covered in the section titled
  <a href="#embedding"></a>.</p>

<p>If type <tref>coercion</tref> rules are specified in the <code>@context</code> for
a particular <tref>term</tref> or property IRI, an IRI is generated:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Type coercion">
<!--
{****
  "@context":
  {
    ...
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
    ...
  }****
...
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In the example above, even though the value
<code>http://manu.sporny.org/</code> is expressed as a JSON
<tref>string</tref>, the type <tref>coercion</tref> rules will transform
the value into an IRI when generating the <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Node Identifiers</h2>

<p>To be able to externally reference nodes in a graph, it is important that each <tref>node</tref> has
  an unambiguous identifier. <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> are a fundamental concept of
  <tref>Linked Data</tref>, and nodes should have a de-referencable
  identifier used to name and locate them. For nodes to be truly linked,
  de-referencing the identifier should result in a representation of that node
  (for example, using a URL to retrieve a web page).
  Associating an IRI with a node tells an application that the returned
  document contains a description of the node requested.</p>

<p>JSON-LD documents may also contain descriptions of other nodes, so it is necessary to be able to
  uniquely identify each node which may be externally referenced.</p>

<p>The node of a <tref>JSON object</tref> is identified using the <code>@id</code>
  <tref>keyword</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Identifying a node">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ...
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
    ...
  },
  "****@id****": "****http://example.org/people#joebob****",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The example above contains a <tref>node object</tref> identified by the IRI
  <code>http://example.org/people#joebob</code>.</p>

<p>Once defined, the <tref>node</tref>'s unique identifier can be used to refer to
  it from other parts of the document or from external documents, using
  a <tref>node object</tref> that only contains an <code>@id</code> key:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Referencing a node using its unique identifier">
<!--
{
  "@context": ...,
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "http://example.org/library",
      "@type": "ex:Library",
      ****"ex:contains": {"@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic"}****
    }, {
      "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic",
      "@type": "ex:Book",
      "dc:creator": "Plato",
      "dc:title": "The Republic",
      ****"ex:contains": {"@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction"}****
    }, {
      "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction",
      "@type": "ex:Chapter",
      "dc:description": "An introductory chapter on The Republic.",
      "dc:title": "The Introduction"
    }
  ]
}
}-->
</pre>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Specifying the Type</h2>

<p>The type of a particular node can be specified using the <code>@type</code>
  <tref>keyword</tref>. In <tref>Linked Data</tref>, types are uniquely
  identified with an <tref>IRI</tref>.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifying the type for a node">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "****@type****": "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person****",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>A node can be assigned more than one type by using the following markup
pattern:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifying multiple types for a node">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/places#BrewEats",
  "****@type****": ****["http://schema.org/Restaurant", "http://schema.org/Brewery"]****
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The value of a <code>@type</code> key may also be a <tref>term</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref>:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a term to specify the type">

<section>
<h2>String Internationalization</h2>

<p>At times, it is important to annotate a <tref>string</tref>
  with its language. In JSON-LD this is possible in a variety of ways.
  Firstly, it is possible to define a default language for a JSON-LD document
  by setting the <code>@language</code> key in the <code>@context</code> or in a
  <tref>term</tref> definition:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Setting the default language of a JSON-LD document">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    ...
    "@language": "ja"
  },****
  "name": ****"花澄"****,
  "occupation": ****"科学者"****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The example above would associate the <code>ja</code> language
  code with the two <tref title="string">strings</tref> <em>花澄</em> and <em>科学者</em>.
  Languages codes are defined in [[!BCP47]].</p>

<p>It is possible to override the default language by using an <tref>expanded value</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Overriding default language using an expanded value">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ...
    "@language": "ja"
  },
  "name": "花澄",
  "occupation": ****{
    "@value": "Scientist",
    "@language": "en"
  }****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to override the default language or specify a plain
value by omitting the <code>@language</code> tag or setting it to
<code>null</code> when expressing the <tref>expanded value</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Removing language information using an expanded value">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ...
    "@language": "ja"
  },
  "name": ****{
    "@value": "Frank"
  },****
  "occupation": **** {
    "@value": "Ninja",
    "@language": "en"
  }****,
  "speciality": "手裏剣"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Please note that language associations can only be applied to plain
  literal <tref title="string">strings</tref>. That is,
  <tref title="typed value">typed values</tref> or values that are subject
  to <a href="#type-coercion"></a> cannot be language tagged.</p>

<p>To clear the default language for a subtree, <code>@language</code> can
be set to <code>null</code> in a <tref>local context</tref> as follows:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Clearing default language">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ...
    "@language": "ja"
  },
  "name": "花澄",
  "details": {
****    "@context": {
      "@language": null
    },****
    "occupation": "Ninja"
  }
}
-->
</pre>

<p class="note">JSON-LD allows one to associate language information with
  <tref title="term">terms</tref>. See <a href="#expanded-term-definition"></a> for
  more details.</p>

  <h2>JSON-LD Syntax</h2>

  <p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> is first, and foremost, a JSON document
    (as defined in [[!RFC4627]]). However, JSON-LD
    describes a specific syntax to use for expressing Linked Data. This
    includes the use of specific keywords, as identified in <a
    href="#syntax-tokens-and-keywords"></a> for
    expressing <a title="node object">node objects</a>, values,
    and the <a>context</a>. See <a
    href="#json-ld-grammar"></a> for authoring
    guidelines.</p>

</section>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Advanced Concepts</h1>

<em>This section is normative.</em>

<p>JSON-LD has a number of features that provide functionality above and beyond
the core functionality described above. The following section describes this
advanced functionality in more detail.
</p>

<section>
  <h2>Compact IRIs</h2>
  <p>
    <tref title="term">Terms</tref> in <tref>Linked Data</tref> documents may draw from
    a number of different <tref title="vocabulary">vocabularies</tref>.
    At times, declaring every single <tref>term</tref> that a document uses can require the
    developer to declare tens, if not hundreds of potential
    <tref>vocabulary</tref> <tref title="term">terms</tref> that are used across an
    application. This is a concern for at least two reasons: the
    first is the cognitive load on the developer of remembering all of the
    <tref title="term">terms</tref>, and the second is the serialized size of the
    <tref>context</tref> if it is specified inline. In order to address these issues,
    the concept of a <tref>compact IRI</tref> is introduced.</p>
  <p>
    A <tdef>compact IRI</tdef> is a way of expressing an <tref>IRI</tref>
    using a <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> separated by a colon (<code>:</code>) which is
    similar to the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#s_curies">CURIE Syntax</a></cite>
    in [[RDFA-CORE]]. The <tdef>prefix</tdef> is a <tref>term</tref> taken from the
    <tref>active context</tref> and is a short string identifying a
    particular <tref>IRI</tref> in a JSON-LD document.
    For example, the prefix <code>foaf</code> may be used as a short
    hand for the Friend-of-a-Friend vocabulary, which is identified using
    the IRI <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>. A developer may append
    any of the FOAF <tref>vocabulary</tref> terms to the end of the prefix
    to specify a short-hand version of the <tref>absolute IRI</tref> for the
    <tref>vocabulary</tref> term. For example, <code>foaf:name</code> would
    be expanded out to the IRI <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>.
    Instead of having to remember and type out the entire IRI, the developer
    can instead use the prefix in their JSON-LD markup.
  </p>
  <p>Terms are interpreted as <tref title="compact IRI">compact IRIs</tref> if they contain at least one
    colon and the first colon is not followed by two slashes (<code>//</code>, as in
    <code>http://example.com</code>). To generate the full <tref>IRI</tref>,
    the value is first split into a <em>prefix</em> and <em>suffix</em> at the first
    occurrence of a colon (<code>:</code>). If the <tref>active context</tref>
    contains a term mapping for <em>prefix</em>, an IRI is generated by
    prepending the mapped <em>prefix</em> to the (possibly empty) <em>suffix</em>
    using textual concatenation.  If no prefix mapping is defined, the value is interpreted
    as an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>. If the prefix is an underscore
    (<code>_</code>), the IRI remains unchanged.
  </p>
  <p>Consider the following example:</p>
  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Compact IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/",****
    ****"ex": "http://example.org/vocab#"****
  },
  "@id": "http://example.org/library",
  "@type": ****"ex:Library"****,
  ****"ex:contains"****:
  {
    "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic",
    "@type": ****"ex:Book"****,
    ****"dc:creator"****: "Plato",
    ****"dc:title"****: "The Republic",
    ****"ex:contains"****:
    {
      "@id": "http://example.org/library/the-republic#introduction",
      "@type": ****"ex:Chapter"****,
      ****"dc:description"****: "An introductory chapter on The Republic.",
      ****"dc:title"****: "The Introduction"
    }
  }
}
-->
  </pre>
  <p>
    In this example, two different <tref title="vocabulary">vocabularies</tref>
    are referred to using prefixes. Those prefixes are then used as type and
    property values using the compact IRI <code>prefix:suffix</code> notation.
  </p>
  <p>It's also possible to use compact IRIs within the context as shown in the
    following example:</p>
  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using vocabularies">

<h2>Typed Values</h2>

<p>
  A value with an associated type, also known as a
  <tref>typed value</tref>, is indicated by associating a value with
  an <tref>IRI</tref> which indicates the value's type. Typed values may be
  expressed in JSON-LD in three ways:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>By utilizing the <code>@type</code> <tref>keyword</tref> when defining
    a <tref>term</tref> within a <code>@context</code> section.</li>
  <li>By utilizing an <tref>expanded typed value</tref>.</li>
  <li>By using a native JSON type such as <tref>number</tref>, <tref>true</tref>, or <tref>false</tref>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first example uses the <code>@type</code> keyword to associate a
type with a particular <tref>term</tref> in the <code>@context</code>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition with type coercion">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    "modified":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified",
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
    }
  },****
...
  "modified": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The <em>modified</em> key's value above is automatically type coerced to a
datetime value because of the information specified in the
<code>@context</code>.</p>

<p>The second example uses the expanded form of setting the type information
in the body of a JSON-LD document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded value with type">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "modified":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified"
    }
  },
...
  "modified":
  ****{
    "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
    "@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"
  }****
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Both examples above would generate the value
  <code>2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00</code> with the type
  <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</code>. Note that it is
  also possible to use a <tref>term</tref> or a <tref>compact IRI</tref> to
  express the value of a type.</p>

<p>The <code>@type</code> <tref>keyword</tref> is also used to associate a type
  with a <tref>node</tref>. The concept of a <tdef>node type</tdef> and
  a <tdef>value type</tdef> are different. This is similar to object-oriented
  programming languages where both scalar and structured types use the same
  class inheritance mechanism, even though scalar types and structured types are
  inherently different.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Example demonstrating the context-sensitivity for @type">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/posts#TripToWestVirginia",
  ****"@type": "http://schema.org/BlogPosting"****,
  "modified":
  {
    "@value": "2010-05-29T14:17:39+02:00",
    ****"@type": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime"****
  }
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The first use of <code>@type</code> associates a <tref>node type</tref>
  (<code>http://schema.org/BlogPosting</code>) with the <tref>node</tref>,
  which is expressed using the <code>@id</code> <tref>keyword</tref>.
  The second use of <code>@type</code> associates a <tref>value type</tref>
  (<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime</code>) with the
  value expressed using the <code>@value</code> <tref>keyword</tref>. As a
  general rule, when <code>@value</code> and <code>@type</code> are used in
  the same <tref>JSON object</tref>, the <code>@type</code>
  <tref>keyword</tref> is expressing a <tref>value type</tref>.
  Otherwise, the <code>@type</code> <tref>keyword</tref> is expressing a
  <tref>node type</tref>.</p>

<h2>Language-tagged Strings</h2>

<p>
  A string with an associated language, also known as a
  <tref>language-tagged string</tref>, is indicated by associating a string with
  a language code as defined in [[!BCP47]]. Language-tagged strings may be
  expressed in JSON-LD in four ways:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>By defining a global language using the <code>@language</code>
    <tref>keyword</tref> within a <code>@context</code> section.</li>
  <li>By utilizing the <code>@language</code> <tref>keyword</tref> when defining
    a <tref>term</tref> within a <code>@context</code> section.</li>
  <li>By utilizing an <tref>expanded language-tagged string</tref>.</li>
  <li>By utilizing a <tref>language map</tref>, provided the underlying
    <code>term</code> is defined with a <code>@container</code>
    <tref>keyword</tref> whose value is <code>@language</code> within
    a <code>@context</code> section.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first example uses the <code>@language</code> keyword to associate a
type with a particular <tref>term</tref> in the <code>@context</code>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition with language coercion">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    "title":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title",
      "@language": "en"
    }
  },****
...
  "title": "JSON-LD Syntax",
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The <em>modified</em> key's value above is automatically
  language coerced to a English value because of the information specified in
  the <code>@context</code>.</p>

<p>The second example uses the expanded form of setting the language information
in the body of a JSON-LD document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded value with language">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "title":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title"
    }
  },
...
  "title":
  ****{
    "@value": "JSON-LD Syntax",
    "@language": "en"
  }****
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Both examples above would generate the value <code>JSON-LD Syntax</code>
  tagged with the language <code>en</code>; which is the [[!BCP47]] code
  for the English language.</p>

<p>Systems that support multiple languages often need to express data values in
each language. Typically, such systems also try to ensure that developers have
a programatically easy way to navigate the datastructures for the
language-specific data. In this case, <tref title="language map">language maps</tref>
may be utilized.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Language map expressing a property in three languages">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "title":
    {
      "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title",
      ****"@container": "@language"****
    }
  },
...
  "title":
  ****{
    "en": "JSON-LD Syntax",
    "ru": "JSON-LD Синтаксис",
    "ja": "JSON-LDの構文"
  }****
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the title is expressed in three languages; English,
  Russian, and Japanese. To access the data above in a programming language
  supporting dot-notation accessors for object properties, a developer may
  use the <code>property.language</code> pattern. For example, to access the
  Japanese version of the title, a developer would use the following code
  snippet: <code>obj.title.ja</code>.</p>

<h2>Referencing Contexts from JSON Documents</h2>

<p>Ordinary JSON documents can be transformed into JSON-LD documents by referencing
to an external JSON-LD <tref>context</tref> in an HTTP Link Header. Doing this
allows JSON to be unambiguously machine-readable without requiring developers to
drastically change their workflow and provides an upgrade path for existing
infrastructure without breaking existing clients that rely on the <code>application/json</code>
media type.
</p>

<p>
In order to use an external context with an ordinary JSON document, an author
MUST specify an <tref>IRI</tref> to a valid <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> in an HTTP Link
Header [[!RFC5988]] using the <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> link relation.

The referenced document MUST have a top-level <tref>node object</tref>. The
<code>@context</code> subtree within that object is added to the top-level
<tref>node object</tref> of the referencing document. If an <tref>array</tref> is at the top-level of the
referencing document and its items are <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>, the <code>@context</code>
subtree is added to all <tref>array</tref> items. All extra information located outside
of the <code>@context</code> subtree in the referenced document MUST be
discarded.
</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the use of an external context with an
ordinary JSON document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifing context through HTTP header">
<!--
GET /ordinary-json-document.json HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/ld+json,application/json,*/*;q=0.1

====================================

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
...
Content-Type: ****application/json****
****Link: <http://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"****

{
  "name": "Markus Lanthaler",
  "homepage": "http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/",
  "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/markuslanthaler"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Please note that <tref title="JSON-LD document">JSON-LD documents</tref>
  served with the <code>application/ld+json</code>
  media type MUST have all context information, including references to external
  contexts, within the body of the document. Contexts linked via a
  <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</code> HTTP Link Header MUST be
  ignored for such documents.</p>

<section>
<h3>Expanded Term Definition</h3>

<p>Within a <tref>context</tref> definition, <tref title="term">terms</tref> may be
   defined using an <tref>expanded term definition</tref> to allow for additional information
   associated with the <tref>term</tref> to be specified (see also
   <a href="#type-coercion"></a> and
   <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>).</p>

<p>Instead of using a string representation of an IRI, the IRI may be
specified using a <tref>JSON object</tref> having an <code>@id</code> key,
and a <tref>term</tref>, a <tref>compact IRI</tref>, or an
<tref>absolute IRI</tref> as value.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "foaf": ****{ "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" }****,
    "name": ****{ "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name" }****,
    "homepage": ****{ "@id": "foaf:homepage" }****,
    "depiction": ****{ "@id": "foaf:depiction" }****
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/",
  "depiction": "http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/manusporny"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>This allows additional information to be associated with the term. This
  may be used for <a href="#type-coercion"></a>,
  <a href="#sets-and-lists"></a>, or to associate language
  information with a <tref>term</tref> as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition with language">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    ...
    "ex": "http://example.com/",
    "@language": "ja",
    "name": { "@id": "ex:name", ****"@language": null**** },
    "occupation": { "@id": "ex:occupation" },
    "occupation_en": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "en"**** },
    "occupation_cs": { "@id": "ex:occupation", ****"@language": "cs"**** }
  },
  ****"name": "Yagyū Muneyoshi",
  "occupation": "忍者",
  "occupation_en": "Ninja",
  "occupation_cs": "Nindža",****
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The example above would associate <em>忍者</em> with the specified default
  language code <code>ja</code>, <em>Ninja</em> with the language code
  <code>en</code>, and <em>Nindža</em> with the language code <code>cs</code>.
  The value of <code>name</code>, <em>Yagyū Muneyoshi</em> wouldn't be
  associated with any language code since <code>@language</code> was reset to
  <tref>null</tref> in the <tref>expanded term definition</tref>.</p>

<p>Expanded terms may also be defined using <tref title="compact_iri">compact IRIs</tref> or
  <tref title="absolute_IRI">absolute IRIs</tref> as keys. If the definition does not include an
  <code>@id</code> key, the expanded IRI is determined by performing expansion of the key
  within the current <tref>active context</tref>. This mechanism is mainly used to associate type or language
  information with a <tref>compact IRI</tref> or an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>.</p>

<p class="note">While it is possible to define a
  <tref>compact IRI</tref>, or an absolute IRI to expand to some
  other unrelated IRI (for example, <code>foaf:name</code> expanding to
  <code>http://example.org/unrelated#species</code>),
  such usage is strongly discouraged.</p>

<section>
<h2>Type Coercion</h2>

<p>JSON-LD supports the coercion of values to particular data types.
Type <tdef>coercion</tdef> allows someone deploying JSON-LD to coerce the incoming or
outgoing values to the proper data type based on a mapping of data type <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> to
<tref title="term">terms</tref>. Using type coercion, value representation is preserved without requiring
the data type to be specified with each piece of data.</p>

<p>Type coercion is specified within an <a href="#expanded-term-definition"></a>
  using the <code>@type</code> key. The value of this key expands to an <tref>IRI</tref>.
  Alternatively, the <tref>keyword</tref> <code>@id</code> may be used as value to indicate
  that within the body of a JSON-LD document, a string value of a <tref>term</tref> coerced to
  <code>@id</code> is to be interpreted as an <tref>IRI</tref>.</p>

<p><tref title="term">Terms</tref> or <tref title="compact_iri">compact IRIs</tref> used as the value of a
  <code>@type</code> key may be defined within the same context. This means that one may specify a
  <tref>term</tref> like <code>xsd</code> and then use <code>xsd:integer</code> within the same
  context definition.</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates how a JSON-LD author can coerce values to
<tref title="typed value">typed values</tref>, IRIs and lists.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded term definition with types">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age":
    ****{
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    }****,
    "homepage":
    ****{
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id",
      "@container": "@list"
    }****
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/people#john",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": ****"41"****,
  "homepage":
  ****[
    "http://personal.example.org/",
    "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  ]****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The markup shown above would generate the following data. The data has no inherent order
  except for the values the <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</code> property
  which represent an ordered list.</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Object</th>
  <th>Datatype</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.com/people#john</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</td>
  <td>John Smith</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.com/people#john</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age</td>
  <td>41</td>
  <td>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2">http://example.com/people#john</td>
  <td rowspan="2">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</td>
  <td>http://personal.example.org/</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://work.example.com/jsmith/</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Terms may also be defined using <tref title="absolute iri">absolute IRIs</tref> or <tref title="compact_iri">compact IRIs</tref>.
  This allows coercion rules to be applied to keys which are not represented as a simple <tref>term</tref>.
  For example:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Term definitions using compact and absolute IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "****foaf:age****":
    {
      ****"@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age"****,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****":
    {
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  "foaf:name": "John Smith",
  "****foaf:age****": "41",
  "****http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage****":
  [
    "http://personal.example.org/",
    "http://work.example.com/jsmith/"
  ]
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In this case the <code>@id</code> definition in the term definition is optional, but if it does exist, the <tref>compact IRI</tref>
  or <tref>IRI</tref> is treated as a <tref>term</tref> (not a <code>prefix:suffix</code> construct)
  so that the actual definition of a <tref>prefix</tref> becomes unnecessary. Type coercion is performed using
  the unexpanded value of the key, which has to match exactly an entry in the <tref>active context</tref>.</p>

<p class="note">Keys in the context are treated as <tref title="term">terms</tref> for the purpose of
  expansion and value coercion. At times, this may result in multiple representations for the same expanded IRI.
  For example, one could specify that <code>dog</code> and <code>cat</code> both expanded to <code>http://example.com/vocab#animal</code>.
  Doing this could be useful for establishing different type coercion or language specification rules. It also allows a <tref>compact IRI</tref> (or even an
  absolute <tref>IRI</tref>) to be defined as something else entirely. For example, one could specify that
  the <tref>term</tref> <code>http://example.org/zoo</code> should expand to
  <code>http://example.org/river</code>, but this usage is discouraged because it would lead to a
  great deal of confusion among developers attempting to understand the JSON-LD document.</p>


</section>


<section>
<h2>Property Generators</h2>

<p>At times, an author may find that they need to express the same value for
multiple properties. The simplest approach to accomplish this goal would be
to do the following:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Verbose expression of multiple properties with the same value">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"title1": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title"****,
    ****"title2": "http://schema.org/name"****,
    ****"title3": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"****
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/book",
  ****"title1": "The Count of Monte Cristo"****,
  ****"title2": "The Count of Monte Cristo"****,
  ****"title3": "The Count of Monte Cristo"****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the approach above produces redundant data and would become a
publishing burden for large data sets.
In these situations, the author may use
a <tdef>property generator</tdef> to express a <tref>term</tref> that maps to
multiple <tref title="property">properties</tref> in the <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>.
This method can be accomplished by using the following markup pattern:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Generating multiple properties using a single term">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"title": { "@id": [ "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title",
                        "http://schema.org/name",
                        "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label" ] }****
  },
  "@id": "http://example.com/book",
  ****"title": "The Count of Monte Cristo"****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>While the term above is only used once outside of the <code>@context</code>,
the document above is equivalent to the following set of statements:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Set of statements generated by the previous example">
<!--
<http://example.com/book>
  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title>
    "The Count of Monte Cristo" .
<http://example.com/book>
  <http://schema.org/name>
    "The Count of Monte Cristo" .
<http://example.com/book>
  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>
    "The Count of Monte Cristo" .
-->
</pre>

<section>
  <h2>IRI Expansion Within a Context</h2>
  <p>In general, normal IRI expansion rules apply
    anywhere an IRI is expected (see <a href="#iris"></a>). Within
    a <tref>context</tref> definition, this can mean that terms defined
    within the context may also be used within that context as long as
    there are no circular dependencies. For example, it is common to use
    the <code>xsd</code> namespace when defining <tref>typed value</tref>s:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="IRI expansion within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"****,
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "age":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age",
      "@type": ****"xsd:integer"****
    },
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>xsd</code> <tref>term</tref> is defined
  and used as a <tref>prefix</tref> for the <code>@type</code> coercion
  of the <code>age</code> property.</p>

<p><tref title="term">Terms</tref> may also be used when defining the IRI of another
<tref>term</tref>:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a term to define the IRI of another term within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": ****"foaf:name"****,
    "age":
    {
      "@id": ****"foaf:age"****,
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "homepage":
    {
      "@id": ****"foaf:homepage"****,
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p><tref title="compact iri">Compact IRIs</tref>
  and <tref title="iri">IRIs</tref> may be used on the left-hand side of a
  <tref>term</tref> definition.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using a compact IRI as a term">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"****,
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "name": "foaf:name",
    "****foaf:age****":
    {
      "@type": "xsd:integer"
    },
    "****foaf:homepage****":
    ****{
      "@type": "@id"
    }****
  },
  ...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the <tref>compact IRI</tref> form is used in two different
ways.
In the first approach, <code>foaf:age</code> declares both the
<tref>IRI</tref> for the <tref>term</tref> (using short-form) as well as the
<code>@type</code> associated with the <tref>term</tref>. In the second
approach, only the <code>@type</code> associated with the <tref>term</tref> is
specified. The full <tref>IRI</tref> for
<code>foaf:homepage</code> is determined by looking up the <code>foaf</code>
<tref>prefix</tref> in the
<tref>context</tref>.
</p>

<p>
<tref title="absolute iri">Absolute IRIs</tref> may also be used in the key position in a <tref>context</tref>:
</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Associating context definitions with absolute IRIs">
<!--
{
  "@context":

<p>
In order for the <tref>absolute IRI</tref> to match above, the <tref>absolute IRI</tref> needs to be used in the <tref>JSON-LD document</tref>. Also note that <code>foaf:homepage</code>
will not use the <code>{ "@type": "@id" }</code> declaration because
<code>foaf:homepage</code> is not the same as
<code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage</code>. That is, <tref title="term">terms</tref>
are looked up in a <tref>context</tref> using direct string comparison before the
<tref>prefix</tref> lookup mechanism is applied.
</p>

<p>The only exception for using terms in the <tref>context</tref> is that
  circular definitions are not allowed. That is,
  a definition of <em>term-1</em> cannot depend on the
  definition of <em>term-2</em> if <em>term-2</em> also depends on
  <em>term-1</em>. For example, the following <tref>context</tref> definition
  is illegal:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Illegal circular definition of terms within a context">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    ****"term1": "term2:foo",
    "term2": "term1:bar"****
  },

<h2>Sets and Lists</h2>

<p>A JSON-LD author can express multiple values in a compact way by using
  <tref title="array">arrays</tref>. Since graphs do not describe ordering for links
  between nodes, arrays in JSON-LD do not provide an ordering of the
  contained elements by default. This is exactly the opposite from regular JSON
  arrays, which are ordered by default. For example, consider the following
  simple document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Multiple values with no inherent order">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "nick": ****[ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]****,
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The markup shown above would result in the following data being generated,
  each relating the node to an individual value, with no inherent order:</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Object</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/people#joebob</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</td>
  <td>joe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/people#joebob</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</td>
  <td>bob</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/people#joebob</td>
  <td>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</td>
  <td>jaybee</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Multiple values may also be expressed using the expanded form:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using an expanded form to set multiple values">
<!--
{
  "@id": "http://example.org/articles/8",
  "dc:title": ****
  [
    {
      "@value": "Das Kapital",
      "@language": "de"
    },
    {
      "@value": "Capital",
      "@language": "en"
    }
  ]****
}-->
</pre>

<p>The markup shown above would generate the following data, again with
  no inherent order:</p>

<table class="example">
<thead>
  <th>Subject</th>
  <th>Property</th>
  <th>Object</th>
  <th>Language</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/articles/8</td>
  <td>http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</td>
  <td>Das Kapital</td>
  <td>de</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>http://example.org/articles/8</td>
  <td>http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</td>
  <td>Capital</td>
  <td>en</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>As the notion of ordered collections is rather important in data
  modeling, it is useful to have specific language support. In JSON-LD,
  a list may be represented using the <code>@list</code> <tref>keyword</tref> as follows:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="An ordered collection of values in JSON-LD">
<!--
{
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "foaf:nick":
  ****{
    "@list": [ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]
  }****,
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p>This describes the use of this <tref>array</tref> as being ordered,
  and order is maintained when processing a document. If every use of a given multi-valued
  property is a list, this may be abbreviated by setting <code>@container</code>
  to <code>@list</code> in the <tref>context</tref>:</p>
<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Specifying that a collection is ordered in the context">
<!--
{
  ****"@context":
  {
    ...
    "nick":
    {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick",
      "@container": "@list"
    }
  }****,
...
  "@id": "http://example.org/people#joebob",
  "nick": ****[ "joe", "bob", "jaybee" ]****,
...
}
-->
</pre>

<p class="note">List of lists are not allowed in this version of JSON-LD.
  This decision was made due to the extreme amount of added complexity when
  processing lists of lists.</p>

<p>Similarly to <code>@list</code>, there exists the <tref>keyword</tref> <code>@set</code> to
  describe unordered sets. While its use in the body of a JSON-LD document
  represents just syntactic sugar optimized away when processing
  the document, it is very helpful when used within the context of a document.
  Values of terms associated with a <code>@set</code> or <code>@list</code> container
  are always represented in the form of an <tref>array</tref> - even if there is just a
  single value that would otherwise be optimized to a non-array form in a
  <a href="#compact-document-form"></a>. This makes post-processing of
  the data easier as the data is always in array form, even if the array only
  contains a single value.</p>

<p class="note">The use of <code>@container</code> in the body of a JSON-LD
  document has no meaning and is not allowed by the JSON-LD grammar (see <a href="#json-ld-grammar"></a>).</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Embedding</h2>

  <p><tdef>Embedding</tdef> is a JSON-LD feature that allows an author to
    use <tref title="node object">node objects</tref> as
    <tref>property</tref> values. This is a commonly used mechanism for
    creating a parent-child relationship between two <tref title="node">nodes</tref>.</p>

  <p>The example shows two nodes related by a property from the first node:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Embedding a node object as property value of another node object">
  <!--
  {
  ...
    "name": "Manu Sporny",
    "****knows****":
    {
      "****@type****": "****Person****",
      "****name****": "****Gregg Kellogg****",
    }
  ...
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>
    A <tref>node object</tref>, like the one used above, may be used in
    any value position in the body of a JSON-LD document.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Named Graphs</h2>

  <p>At times, it is necessary to make statements about a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>
    itself, rather than just a single <tref>node</tref>. This can be done by
    grouping a set of <tref title="node">nodes</tref> using the <code>@graph</code>
    <tref>keyword</tref>. A developer may also name data expressed using the
    <code>@graph</code> <tref>keyword</tref> by pairing it with an
    <code>@id</code> <tref>keyword</tref> as shown in the following example:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"

      }
    ]
  }

  </pre>

  <p>The example above expresses a <em>named</em> <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>
    that is identified by the <tref>IRI</tref>
    <code>http://example.org/graphs/73</code>. That graph is composed of the
    statements about Manu and Gregg. Metadata about the graph itself is also
    expressed via the <code>generatedAt</code> property, which specifies when
    the graph was generated. An alternative view of the
    information above is represented in table form below:</p>

  <p>When <code>@graph</code> is used in a document's top-level object which
    has no other <tref title="property">properties</tref> that are mapped
    to an <tref>IRI</tref> or a <tref>keyword</tref> it is considered to
    express the otherwise implicit default graph. This mechanism can be useful
    when a number of <tref title="node">nodes</tref> thay may not directly
    relate to one another through a property or where <tref>embedding</tref>
    is not desirable to the application. For example:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
    title="Using @graph to explicitly express the default graph">
  <!--
  {
    "@context": ...,
    "****@graph****":

        "knows": "http://manu.sporny.org/i/public"
      }
    ]
  }
  -->
  </pre>

  <p>In this case, embedding doesn't work as each <tref>node object</tref>
    references the other. Using the <code>@graph</code> <tref>keyword</tref>
    allows multiple <tref title="node">nodes</tref> to be defined within an
    <tref>array</tref>, and allows the use of a shared <tref>context</tref>.
    This is equivalent to using multiple
    <tref title="node object">node objects</tref> in array and defining
    the <code>@context</code> within each <tref>node object</tref>:</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
    title="Context needs to be duplicated if @graph is not used">

<section>
  <h2>Identifying Blank Nodes</h2>

  <p>At times, it becomes necessary to be able to express information without
    being able to specify the node. This type of node is called a <tref>blank node</tref>
    (see <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-blank-nodes">Section 3.4: Blank Nodes</a></cite>
    of [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]]). In JSON-LD, <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref> are
    automatically created if a node is not specified using the <code>@id</code> <tref>keyword</tref>.
    However, authors may provide identifiers for <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
    by using the special <code>_</code> (underscore) <tref>prefix</tref>. This allows one
    to reference the node locally within the document, but makes it impossible to reference
    the node from an external document. The <tref>blank node identifier</tref> is scoped
    to the document in which it is used.</p>

  <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
       title="Specifying a local blank node identifier">
  <!--
  {
  ...
    "@id": "****_:foo****",
  ...
  }
   -->
  </pre>

  <p>The example above would set the node to <code>_:foo</code>, which can
    then be used elsewhere in the JSON-LD document to refer back to the
    <tref>blank node</tref>. If a developer finds that they refer to the <tref>blank node</tref>
    more than once, they should consider naming the node using a dereferenceable
    <tref>IRI</tref> so that it can also be referenced from other documents.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Aliasing Keywords</h2>

<p>Each of the JSON-LD <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>,
except for <code>@context</code>, may be aliased to application-specific
keywords. This feature allows legacy JSON content to be utilized
by JSON-LD by re-using JSON keys that already exist in legacy documents.
This feature also allows developers to design domain-specific implementations
using only the JSON-LD <tref>context</tref>.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Aliasing keywords">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
     ****"url": "@id"****,
     ****"a": "@type"****,
     "name": "http://schema.org/name"
  },
  "****url****": "http://example.com/about#gregg",
  "****a****": "http://schema.org/Person",
  "name": "Gregg Kellogg"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code>
<tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> have been given the aliases <strong>url</strong> and
<strong>a</strong>, respectively.
</p>

</section>


<section>
<h2>Explicitly Ignoring Data</h2>

<p>At times, it becomes necessary to explicitly ignore data expressed in JSON
documents because it has no semantic meaning. For this purpose, an author
may associate the <tref>null</tref> keyword with a <tref>term</tref> in the
JSON-LD Context.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Using the null keyword to ignore data">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
     "@vocab": "http://schema.org/",
     ****"databaseId": null****
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "description": "That guy",
  "gender": "Male",
  ****"databaseId": "23987520"****
}
-->
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the author has used <code>@vocab</code> as the base
IRI for all terms in the document, but has expressed that the
<code>databaseId</code> value should not be processed by the JSON-LD processor
by associating it with the <tref>null</tref> keyword in the JSON-LD Context.
</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Expanded Document Form</h3>
<p>The JSON-LD API [[JSON-LD-API]] defines an method for <em>expanding</em> a
  JSON-LD document.
  Expansion is the process of taking a JSON-LD document and applying a
  <code>@context</code> such that all IRIs, types, and values
  are expanded so that the <code>@context</code> is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Sample JSON-LD document">
<!--
{
   "@context":
   {
      "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
      "homepage": {
        "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
   },
   "name": "Manu Sporny",
   "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Running the JSON-LD Expansion algorithm against the JSON-LD input document
  provided above would result in the following output:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Expanded form for the previous example">
<!--
[
  {
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [
      { "@value": "Manu Sporny" }
    ],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
      { "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/" }
    ]
  }
]
-->
</pre>

<p>Expanded document form is useful when an application has to process input
data in a deterministic form. It has been optimized to ensure that the code
that developers have to write is minimized compared to the code that would
have to be written to operate on
<a href="#compact-document-form"></a>.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Compact Document Form</h3>
<p>The JSON-LD API [[JSON-LD-API]] defines a method for <em>compacting</em> a JSON-LD document.
  Compaction is the process of taking a JSON-LD document and applying a
  context such that the most compact form of the document is generated. JSON
  is typically expressed in a very compact, key-value format. That is, full
  IRIs are rarely used as keys. At times, a JSON-LD document may be received
  that is not in its most compact form. JSON-LD, via the API, provides a way
  to compact a JSON-LD document.</p>

<p>For example, assume the following JSON-LD input document:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Sample expanded JSON-LD document">
<!--
[
  {
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name": [ "Manu Sporny" ],
    "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage": [
      {
       "@id": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
      }
    ]
  }
]
-->
</pre>

<p>Additionally, assume the following developer-supplied JSON-LD context:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Sample context">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  }
}
-->
</pre>

<p>Running the JSON-LD Compaction algorithm given the context supplied above
  against the JSON-LD input document provided above would result in the following
  output:</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Compact form of the sample document once sample context has been applied">
<!--
{
  "@context": {
    "name": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name",
    "homepage": {
      "@id": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage",
      "@type": "@id"
    }
  },
  "name": "Manu Sporny",
  "homepage": "http://manu.sporny.org/"
}
-->
</pre>

<p>The compaction algorithm enables a developer to map any document into an
  application-specific compacted form by first <a href="#expanded-document-form"></a>.
  While the context provided above mapped <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</code>
  to <strong>name</strong>, it could have also mapped it to any arbitrary string
  provided by the developer. This powerful mechanism allows the developer to
  re-shape the incoming JSON data into a format that is optimized for
  their application.</p>

  <h1>Data Model</h1>

  <p>JSON-LD is a serialization format for <tref>Linked Data</tref> based on JSON.
    It is therefore important to distinguish between the syntax, which is defined
    by JSON in [[RFC4627]], and <tdef title="JSON-LD data model">JSON-LD's data model</tdef>
    which is defined as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <tdef>JSON-LD document</tdef> serializes a collection of
      <tref title="JSON-LD graph">JSON-LD graphs</tref> and comprises exactly one
      <tdef>default graph</tdef> and zero or more <tdef title="named graph">named graphs</tdef>.</li>
    <li>The default graph does not have a name and MAY be empty.</li>
    <li>Each named graph is a pair consisting of an <tref>IRI</tref> or <tref>blank node</tref>
      (the <tdef>graph name</tdef>) and a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>. Whenever possible, the
      <tref>graph name</tref> SHOULD be an <tref>IRI</tref>.</li>
    <li>A <tdef>JSON-LD graph</tdef> is a labeled directed graph, i.e., a set of
      <tref title="node">nodes</tref> connected by <tref title="edge">edges</tref>.
    <li>Every <tdef>edge</tdef> has a direction associated with it and is labeled with
      an <tref>IRI</tref> or a <tref>blank node identifier</tref>. Within the JSON-LD syntax
      these edge labels are called <tdef title="property">properties</tdef>. Whenever possible, an
      <tref>edge</tref> SHOULD be labeled with an <tref>IRI</tref>.</li>
    <li>Every <tdef>node</tdef> is an <tref>IRI</tref>, a <tref>blank node</tref>,
      a <tref>JSON-LD value</tref>, or a <tref>list</tref>.</li>
    <li>A node having an outgoing edge MUST be an <tref>IRI</tref> or a
      <tref>blank node</tref>.</li>

<h2>JSON-LD Grammar</h2>
<em>This section is normative</em>

<p class="issue" data-number="114">This section is an attempt to formalize
a normative grammar for JSON-LD.</p>

<p>This appendix restates the syntactic conventions described in the
  previous sections more formally.</p>

<p class="note">The JSON-LD context allows <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>
  <a href="#aliasing-keywords"></a>). Whenever a <tref>keyword</tref> is
  discussed in this grammar, this is also understood to apply to an alias for
  that <tref>keyword</tref>. For example, if the <tref>active context</tref>
  defines the <tref>term</tref> <code>id</code> as an alias for <code>@id</code>,
  that alias may be legitimately used as a substitution for <code>@id</code>.
  Note that <tref>keyword</tref> aliases are not expanded during context
  processing.</p>

<p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> MUST be a valid JSON document as described
  in [[!RFC4627]].</p>

<p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> MUST be a single <tref>node object</tref>
  or a JSON <tref>array</tref> containing a set of one or more
  <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>.</p>

<section id="grammar-node-object">
<h3>Node Object</h3>

<p>A <tdef>node object</tdef> represents zero or more properties of a
  <tref>node</tref> in the <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref> serialized by the
  <tref>JSON-LD document</tref>.

  A <tref>JSON Object</tref> is a <tref>node object</tref> if
  it exists outside of the JSON-LD Context and:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>it does not contain the <code>@value</code>, <code>@list</code>,
    or <code>@set</code> keywords, or</li>
    <li>it does not contain the <code>@graph</code> keyword and is
    the top-most <tref>JSON Object</tref> in the JSON-LD document.
  </ul>

  The properties of a <tref>node</tref> in the <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref>
  may be spread among different <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>
  within a document. When that happens,
  the keys of the different <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>
  are merged to create the properties of the resulting <tref>node</tref>.</p>

<p>A <tref>node object</tref> MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref> that contains
  one or more key-value pairs. Keys MUST either be
  <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>,
  <tref title="compact IRI">compact IRIs</tref>,
  <tref title="term">terms</tref> valid in the <tref>active context</tref>, or
  one of the following <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>@context</code>,</li>
  <li><code>@graph</code>,</li>
  <li><code>@id</code>, or</li>
  <li><code>@type</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@context</code>
  key, its value MUST be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an <tref>IRI</tref>,</li>
  <li>a <tref>context definition</tref>, or</li>
  <li>an <tref>array</tref> composed of any number of the previous two expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@id</code> key, its value MUST be
  an <tref>IRI</tref>,
  a <tref>compact IRI</tref> (including <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifiers</tref>), or
  a <tref>term</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref> expanding
  into an <tref>IRI</tref> or a <tref>blank node identifier</tref>.
  See <a href="#node-identifiers"></a>, <a href="#compact-iris"></a>,
  and <a href="#identifying-blank-nodes"></a> for further discussion on
  <code>@id</code> values.</p>

<p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@type</code>
  key, its value MUST be either
  an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>,
  a <tref>compact IRI</tref> (excluding <tref title="blank node identifier">blank node identifier</tref>),
  a <tref>term</tref> defined in the <tref>active context</tref> expanding into an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>, or
  an <tref>array</tref> of any of these.
  See <a href="#specifying-the-type"></a> for further discussion on
  <code>@type</code> values.</p>

<p>If the <tref>node object</tref> contains the <code>@graph</code>
  key, its value MUST be
  a <tref>node object</tref> or
  an <tref>array</tref> of zero or more <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>.
  If the <tref>node object</tref> contains an <code>@id</code> keyword,
  its value is used as the label of a named graph.
  See <a href="#named-graphs"></a> for further discussion on
  <code>@graph</code> values.</p>

<p class="note">As a special case, if a <tref>JSON object</tref> contains no
  keys other than <code>@graph</code> and <code>@context</code>, and the
  <tref>JSON object</tref> is the root of the JSON-LD document, the
  <tref>JSON object</tref> is not treated as a <tref>node object</tref>; this
  is used as a way of defining <tref title="node object">node
  definitions</tref> that may not form a connected graph. This allows a
  <tref>context</tref> to be defined which is shared by all of the constituent
  <tref title="node object">node objects</tref>.</p>

<p>A <tref>JSON-LD document</tref> MUST NOT contain any <tref>keyword</tref> or
  alias that expands to another keyword.</p>
<!-- tidoust: clarify? -->

<p>Keys in a <tref>node object</tref> that are not
  <tref title="keyword">keywords</tref> MUST expand to an <tref>absolute IRI</tref>
  using the <tref>active context</tref>. The values associated with these keys
  MUST be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tref>string</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>number</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>true</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>false</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>null</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>node object</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>expanded typed value</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>expanded language-tagged string</tref>,</li>
  <li><tref>list</tref> or <tref>set</tref>,</li>
  <li>an <tref>array</tref> of zero or more of the above possibilities, or</li>
  <li>a <tref>language map</tref></li>
</ul>

  <h2>Term</h2>
  <p>A <tdef>term</tdef> is a short-hand <tref>string</tref> that expands

  <p>A <tref>term</tref> MUST NOT equal any of the JSON-LD

<h2>Expanded Values</h2>

<p>An <tdef>expanded value</tdef> is used to explicitly associate a type or a

<h2>List and Set Values</h2>

<p>A <tref>list</tref> represents an <em>ordered</em> set of values.
  A <tdef>set</tdef> represents an <em>unordered</em> set of values.
  Unless otherwise specified (typically through the use of a <tref>list</tref>),
  <tref title="array">arrays</tref> are unordered in JSON-LD. As such, the
  <code>@set</code> keyword, when used in the body of a JSON-LD document,
  represents just syntactic sugar which is optimized away when processing the document.
  However, it is very helpful when used within the context of a document. Values
  of terms associated with a <code>@set</code> or <code>@list</code> container
  will always be represented in the form of an array when a document is processed -
  even if there is just a single value that would otherwise be optimized to
  a non-array form in <a href="#compact-document-form">compact document form</a>.
  This simplifies post-processing of the data as the data is always in array form.</p>

<p>A <tref>list</tref> MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref> that contains a single key-value pair where the key is <code>@list</code>.</p>

<p>A <tref>set</tref> MUST be a <tref>JSON object</tref> that contains a single key-value pair where the key is <code>@set</code>.</p>

<p>In both cases, the value associated with the key MUST be an <tref>array</tref> of any of the following:</p>

  <h2>Relationship to RDF</h2>

  <p>The RDF data model, as outlined in [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]], is an abstract syntax for
    representing a directed graph of information. It is a subset of
    <tref title="JSON-LD data model">JSON-LD's data model</tref> with a few
    additional constraints. The differences between the two data models are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In JSON-LD <tref title="graph name">graph names</tref> can be
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> or <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
      whereas in RDF graph names have to be <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>.</li>
    <li>In JSON-LD <tref title="property">properties</tref> can be
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref> or <tref title="blank node">blank nodes</tref>
      whereas in RDF properties (predicates) have to be
      <tref title="IRI">IRIs</tref>.</li>
    <li>In contrast to RDF graphs <tref title="JSON-LD graph">JSON-LD graphs</tref>
      support unconnected <tref title="node">nodes</tref>, i.e., nodes which are not
      connected to any other node.</li>
    <li>In JSON-LD lists are part of the data model whereas in RDF they are part of
      a vocabulary, namely [[RDF-SCHEMA]].</li>
    <li>RDF values are either typed <em>literals</em>
      (<tref title="typed value">typed values</tref>) or <em>language-tagged strings</em>
      (<tref title="language-tagged string">language-tagged strings</tref>) whereas
      JSON-LD also supports JSON's native data types, i.e., <tref title="number">number</tref>,
      <tref title="string">strings</tref>, and the boolean values <tref>true</tref>
      and <tref>false</tref>. The JSON-LD API [[JSON-LD-API]] specification defines
      the conversion rules between JSON's native data types and RDF's counterparts to
      allow full round-tripping.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Summarized these differences mean that JSON-LD is capable of serializing any RDF
    graph or dataset and most, but not all, JSON-LD documents can be transformed to RDF.
    A complete description of the algorithms to convert from RDF to JSON-LD and from
    JSON-LD to RDF is included in the JSON-LD API [[JSON-LD-API]] specification.</p>

  <p>Even though JSON-LD serializes RDF datasets, it can also be used as a RDF graph source.
    In that case, a consumer MUST only use the default graph and ignore all named graphs.
    This allows servers to expose data in, e.g., both Turtle and JSON-LD using content
    negotiation.</p>

<p>An example JSON-LD implementation using a single <tref>context</tref> is
described below.</p>

<h3>Microformats</h3>

<p>The following example uses a simple Microformats hCard example to express
how the Microformat is represented in JSON-LD.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="HTML fragment with a simple Microformats hCard">
<!--
<div class="vcard">
 <a class="url fn" href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek Çelik</a>
</div>
-->
</pre>

<p>The representation of the hCard expresses the Microformat terms in the
<tref>context</tref> and uses them directly for the <code>url</code> and <code>fn</code>
properties. Also note that the Microformat to JSON-LD processor has
generated the proper URL type for <code>http://tantek.com/</code>.</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="Same hCard representation in JSON-LD">
<!--
{
  "@context":
  {
    "vcard": "http://microformats.org/profile/hcard#vcard",
    "url":
    {
      "@id": "http://microformats.org/profile/hcard#url",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
    "fn": "http://microformats.org/profile/hcard#fn"
  },
  "@type": "vcard",
  "url": "http://tantek.com/",
  "fn": "Tantek Çelik"
}

<h3>Microdata</h3>

<p>The microdata example below expresses book information as a microdata Work
item.
</p>

<pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
     title="HTML fragments that describes a book using microdata">
<!--
<dl itemscope

</dl>

<p>Note that the JSON-LD representation of the Microdata information stays
true to the desires of the Microdata community to avoid contexts and
instead refer to items by their full <tref>IRI</tref>.</p>

<h1>IANA Considerations</h1>

<p>This section is included merely for standards community review and will be
submitted to the Internet Engineering Steering Group if this specification
becomes a W3C Recommendation.</p>

<h3>application/ld+json</h3>

  <dd>None</dd>
  <dt>Optional parameters:</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>form</code></dt>
      <dd>Determines the serialization form for the JSON-LD document. The only
        valid value at the moment is <code>expanded</code>. If no form is
        specified in an HTTP request header to an HTTP server, the server MAY
        choose any form. If no form is specified in an HTTP response, the form
        MUST NOT be assumed to take any particular form.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>profile</code></dt>
      <dd>A whitespace-separated list of IRIs identifying specific constraints
        or conventions that apply to a JSON-LD document. A profile MUST NOT change
        the semantics of the resource representation when processed without profile
        knowledge, so that clients both with and without knowledge of a profiled
        resource can safely use the same representation. The <code>profile</code>
        parameter MAY also be used by clients to express their preferences in the
        content negotiation process. It is RECOMMENDED that profile IRIs are
        dereferenceable and provide useful documentation at that IRI. This
        specification, however, does not define any formats for such profile
        descriptions.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
  <dd>The same as the <code>application/json</code> MIME media type.</dd>
  <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
  <dd>Since JSON-LD is intended to be a pure data exchange format for
    directed graphs, the serialization SHOULD NOT be passed through a
    code execution mechanism such as JavaScript's <code>eval()</code>
    function. It is RECOMMENDED that a conforming parser does not attempt to
    directly evaluate the JSON-LD serialization and instead purely parse the
    input into a language-native data structure. </dd>
  <dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
  <dd>Not Applicable</dd>
  <dt>Published specification:</dt>
  <dd>The <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/">JSON-LD</a> specification.</dd>
  <dt>Applications that use this media type:</dt>
  <dd>Any programming environment that requires the exchange of
    directed graphs. Implementations of JSON-LD have been created for
    JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP and C++.

<p>Fragment identifiers used with <a href="#application-ld-json">application/ld+json</a>
  resources MAY identify a node in a <tref>JSON-LD graph</tref> expressed in
  the resource. This idiom, which is also used in RDF [[RDF-CONCEPTS]], gives a
  simple way to "mint" new, document-local IRIs to label nodes and therefore contributes
  considerably to the expressive power of JSON-LD.</p>
